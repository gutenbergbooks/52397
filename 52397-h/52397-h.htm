<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">THE SERPENT CHARMER.</p>


<p>A brown man in a white turban sat by the river. It
was night, and a little fire of sticks sent strange gleams
sparkling across the water, and touched the form of the
brown man with splashes of golden light.</p>

<p>The man was playing on a gourd flute. The music&mdash;if
such it could be called&mdash;was in a high key, but stifled and
subdued. Under the man, to keep his crouching body
from the earth, had been spread a piece of scarlet cloth.
In front of him was a round wicker basket, perhaps a
foot in diameter by six inches high.</p>

<p>As the man played, the notes of the flute coming faster
and faster, the lid of the basket began to tremble as by
some pent-up force. Finally the lid slid open, and a
hooded cobra lifted its flat, ugly head. With eyes on those
of the serpent charmer, the cobra began weaving back and
forth in time to the music. Now and then the snake
would hiss and dart its head at the man. The latter
would dodge to avoid the striking fangs, meanwhile keeping
up his flute-playing.</p>

<p>It was an odd scene, truly, to be going forward in a
country like ours&mdash;cut bodily from the mysteries of India
and dropped down on the banks of the Wabash, there,
near the intensely American city of Lafayette.</p>

<p>While the brown man was playing and the cobra
swayed, and danced, and struck its lightning-like but ineffectual
blows, another came into the ring of firelight,
stepping as noiselessly as a slinking panther. He, like
the other, wore a turban, and there was gold in his ears
and necklaces about his throat.</p>

<p>The first man continued his flute-playing. The other,
with a soft laugh, went to the player's side, sank down,
and riveted his own snakelike orbs upon the diamond eyes
of the cobra. Once the serpent struck at him, but he drew
back and continued to look. With one hand the newcomer
took the flute from the player's lips and laid it on
the ground; then, in a silence broken only by the crackling
fires, the eyes of the man snapped and gleamed and held
those of the cobra.</p>

<p>The effect was marvelous. Slowly the cobra ceased its
rhythmical movements and dropped down and down until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
it retreated once more into the basket; then, with a quick
hand, the lid of the receptacle was replaced and secured
with a wooden pin.</p>

<p>"Yadaba!" exclaimed the first man.</p>

<p>"Not here must you call me that, Dhondaram," said
the second. "I am known as Ben Ali."</p>

<p>Dhondaram spat contemptuously.</p>

<p>"'Tis a name of the Turks," he grunted; "a dog's
name."</p>

<p>"It answers as well as any other."</p>

<p>These men were Hindoos, and their talk was in Hindustani.</p>

<p>"You sent for me at Chicago," proceeded Dhondaram;
"you asked me to come to this place on the river, and to
bring with me my most venomous cobra. See! I am
here; and the cobra, you have discovered that the flute has
no power to quiet its hostility. Your eyes did that, Yada&mdash;your
pardon; I should have said Ben Ali. Great is the
power of your eyes. They have lost none of their charms
since last we met."</p>

<p>Ben Ali received this statement moodily. Picking up a
small pebble, he cast it angrily into the fire.</p>

<p>"Why have you brought me here?" inquired Dhondaram,
rolling a cigarette with materials taken from the
breast of his flowing robe.</p>

<p>"Because," answered Ben Ali, "I have made a vow."</p>

<p>"By Krishna," and Dhondaram threw himself forward
to light his cigarette at the fire, "vows are evil things.
They bring trouble&mdash;nothing less."</p>

<p>"This one," hissed Ben Ali, "will bring trouble to an
enemy of mine."</p>

<p>"And to yourself, it may be," added Dhondaram, resuming
his squatting attitude on the scarlet cloth and
whiffing a thin line of vapor into the air.</p>

<p>"The goddess Kali protects me," averred Ben Ali. "It
is written in my forehead."</p>

<p>"What else is written in your forehead?" asked Dhondaram
after a space. "What was it that caused you to
send for me, and to ask me to leave my profitable work
in the museum, come here, and bring the worst of my
hooded pets?"</p>

<p>Ben Ali, in the silence that followed, picked up more
pebbles and cast them into the fire.</p>

<p>"During the feast of Nag-Panchmi," he observed at
last, "years since, Dhondaram, a mad elephant crushed a
boat on the Ganges. You were in the boat, and I
snatched you from certain death."</p>

<p>Dhondaram's face underwent a swift change.</p>

<p>"That, also," he said in a subdued tone, "is written in
my forehead. I remembered it when your letter came
to me. I owe you obedience until the debt is paid. I am
here, Ben Ali. Command me."</p>

<p>"<i>Such baht!</i> You, with the cobra, Dhondaram, will go
against my enemy and fulfill my vow. That will repay
the debt."</p>

<p>A look of fear crossed Dhondaram's face. It passed
quickly, but had not escaped the keen eyes of Ben Ali.</p>

<p>"You are afraid!" and he sneered as he spoke.</p>

<p>"And if I am?" protested the other. "I am bound to
obey, and lose my life, if I must, in paying for the saving
of it during the feast of Nag-Panchmi. Who is
your enemy, Aurung Zeeb?"</p>

<p>Ben Ali struck the ground with his clinched fist.</p>

<p>"Aurung Zeeb is a coward!" he exclaimed. "He fled
and left me to work out my vengeance alone. <i>Hurkutjee!</i>
Let us speak no more of him. You knew of my
brother, the rajah? How our sister married the <i>feringhi</i>,
Captain Lionel Manners, of the English army? How
he died, and his wife perished in the <i>ghats</i>, by <i>suttee</i>?
Of the daughter they left, Margaret Manners? How,
out of hatred to the rajah, I brought the girl to this country
and destroyed her will by the power of the eyes?
How we traveled with the show of Burton Sahib?"</p>

<p>Dhondaram nodded gravely.</p>

<p>"I know," he replied.</p>

<p>"But you do not know of the <i>feringhi</i> boy, the one who
flies in the bird machine, and who is called Motor Matt.
Because of him I have lost the girl, and she was making
much money for me. I was <i>mahout</i> in the show for Burton
Sahib's worst elephant, Rajah. No other could drive
him, or take care of him. You are a <i>sapwallah</i>, a charmer
of serpents, but you are also a charmer of elephants.
You can drive them, Dhondaram, as well as I. You can
take care of this Rajah beast as well as I."</p>

<p>"I learned to work with the elephants from my brother,
the <i>muni</i>," observed Dhondaram. "You have lost the
niece you called Haidee?"</p>

<p>"She is under the care of the British ambassador, but
she is staying in this town. Perhaps I may get her back&mdash;that
I do not know. But my vow, Dhondaram, against
this <i>feringhi</i> boy, Motor Matt. That is for you to carry
out. He has wrecked my plans. I will wreck his. He
has put me in danger of my life. Through me, he shall
be in danger of his own."</p>

<p>"What am I to do?" queried Dhondaram.</p>

<p>"The show of Burton Sahib is some distance from
here, but I will tell you how to find it. The cobra will
help you join it, for Burton Sahib is always watching
for performers. You must learn to do better with this
cobra. By performing with the serpent before Burton
Sahib, you will please him. He must have some one to
take care of the elephant, Rajah. You will apply for the
place. Ha! Do you follow me?"</p>

<p>Dhondaram nodded.</p>

<p>"When you have applied for the place I will tell you
what to do. The air machine must be wrecked. Rajah
will do that. The <i>feringhi</i> boy must be put where he
will not interfere with my plans for my niece&mdash;the cobra
<i>must do that</i>."</p>

<p>Dhondaram stirred restlessly.</p>

<p>"The law of this country," he murmured, "has a long
arm and a heavy fist."</p>

<p>"If you do as I say," went on Ben Ali, "you will not
be reached by the arm nor caught by the fist. You will
be safe, and so will I; and the vow of Ben Ali will have
been carried out."</p>

<p>"You cannot do this yourself?"</p>

<p>"I should be seized if I showed my face again in the
show of Burra Burton! I should be thrown into the
strong house of the <i>feringhis</i> if I appeared among the
tents. Motor Matt has said this, and he has the power
to carry out his threat."</p>

<p>"Had Motor Matt the power to do this when he saved
Haidee?"</p>

<p>"He had."</p>

<p>"And he held his hand! Why?"</p>

<p>"Because Haidee was under the spell of my eyes. In
order to free her, he had to bargain with me. The bargain
was that I should go free, but never to trouble Motor
Matt or the girl any more. With the girl in my
hands, I could secure many rupees from my brother, the
rajah, for her. And I hate that brother. He is rich, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
he made me the keeper of his elephants! He lived in luxury,
but I herded with the coolies."</p>

<p>Again Ben Ali struck his clinched fist on the earth.</p>

<p>"It may be," said Dhondaram, "that Burton Sahib has
secured another keeper for the bad elephant, Rajah? In
that case, he would not want me."</p>

<p>"It is not likely," returned Ben Ali. "All the other
keepers are afraid of Rajah. Aurung Zeeb was the only
Hindoo who could have managed Rajah, and he dare not
return to the show any more than I. Burton Sahib will
want some one, and he will take you. You will go to him,
perform with the cobra, win his favor. Then, and not
till then, you will ask for the post of elephant keeper.
Burton Sahib, my word for it, will give you Rajah to
look after. Then, my friend, you can carry out the terms
of my vow. You will pay your debt, and we shall be
quits. I shall have no further claim on you."</p>

<p>"And I shall escape the arm of the <i>feringhi</i> law?"</p>

<p>"Even so."</p>

<p>"Tell me what I am to do, and how."</p>

<p>Then, as the little tongues of flame threw their weird
play of lights and shadows over the dusky plotters, the
talk went on.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BAD ELEPHANT.</p>


<p>"Great spark-plugs!"</p>

<p>Motor Matt was passing the canvas walls of the
menagerie tent of the "Big Consolidated" when a human
form ricocheted over the top of it and landed directly in
front of him on a pile of hay. The dropping of the
man on the hay was accompanied by a wild sound which
the king of the motor boys recognized as the trumpeting
of an angry elephant. Following this came the noise of
quick movements on the other side of the wall, and
hoarse voices giving sharp commands.</p>

<p>Matt ran to the man who had fallen on the hay. He
was sitting up and staring about him blankly.</p>

<p>"Well, if it isn't Archie Le Bon!" exclaimed Matt.
"What sort of way is that to come out of a tent, Le Bon?"</p>

<p>"Couldn't help myself, Matt," was the answer. "A
couple of tons of mad elephant gave me a starter. Gee!
No more of that in mine. I'm glad this hay happened to
be here."</p>

<p>Le Bon got up. Evidently his brain was dizzy, for he
supported himself against a guy rope.</p>

<p>"Was it Rajah?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Don't you know any better than to fool with that big
lump of iniquity?"</p>

<p>"I do now. Burton has offered twenty-five dollars to
any one connected with the show who'll take Rajah out
in the parade. Thought I'd try it, and I began by doing
my best to make friends with the brute. Rajah was
about two seconds wrapping his trunk around me and
heaving me over the wall. I'm in luck at that, I suppose.
The big fellow might have slammed me on the
ground and danced a hornpipe on me."</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say that Burton is going to have
Rajah in the parade!" exclaimed Matt.</p>

<p>"Says he is," answered Le Bon, "but I'll bet money he
won't get any one to ride the elephant. You'd better
trot along inside. Your Dutch pard, Carl, had a row with
me. We both wanted to try and manage Rajah and annex
the twenty-five, and the only way we could settle the
question was by drawing straws. For all I know, Carl
may be trying to make friends with Rajah now. Head
him off, Matt, or there'll be a dead Dutchman on the
grounds."</p>

<p>"Carl must be crazy!" exclaimed Matt, whirling around
and darting under the canvas.</p>

<p>Archie Le Bon was an acrobat, and one of several
brothers who had a hair-raising act in the circus ring;
and if Archie couldn't manage Rajah, it was a foregone
conclusion that Carl wouldn't be able to.</p>

<p>Still, it was like Carl to be willing to try something
of the sort, and the young motorist was eager to call a
halt in proceedings before it was too late.</p>

<p>Inside the "animal top" a crowd of men was belaboring
Rajah with clubs and sharp prods. The elephant, chained
to stakes firmly planted in the ground, was backing
away as far as the chains would permit, head up and
trunk in the air. Boss Burton, proprietor and manager
of the show, was directing operations.</p>

<p>Matt's Dutch pard was very much in evidence. Armed
with a piece of sharpened iron, he was hopping around
like a pea on a hot griddle, taking a hack at Rajah every
time he saw an opening. Joe McGlory was hopping
around, too, trying to grab the excited Dutchman and
snake him out of harm's way.</p>

<p>Suddenly Rajah lowered his head and executed a wide
sweep with his trunk, in a half circle. Carl and a <i>mahout</i>
who had charge of the other elephants had their feet
knocked from under them. The <i>mahout</i> was thrown flat
and quickly dragged to safety, while Carl was stood on
his head in a bucket&mdash;a bucket that happened to be filled
with water.</p>

<p>McGlory caught Carl by the heels and dragged him out
into the centre of the tent, the Dutchman thrashing his
arms and sputtering as he slid over the ground.</p>

<p>"Confound the brute!" roared Boss Burton; "I'll either
take the kinks out of him and have him in the parade, or
I'll shoot him. Leave him alone for half an hour, and
then we'll maul him some more. How's Le Bon?"</p>

<p>"Not a scratch," Archie Le Bon answered for himself,
coming in under the canvas. "But I might have had a
broken head."</p>

<p>"You've had enough?" queried Burton.</p>

<p>"A great plenty, thank you. I'm no elephant trainer,
Burton, and while I'd like to make a little extra money
I guess I'll look for something that's more congenial."</p>

<p>"Dot's me, too," said Carl to Matt and McGlory. "I
don'd vas some elephant trainers, I bed you. Vat a ugliness
old Racha has! Dot trunk oof his hit me like a railroadt
train."</p>

<p>"You were going to try and ride the elephant in the
parade, Carl?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"I vas t'inking oof id vonce, aber never any more. He
iss vorse as I t'ought."</p>

<p>"I heard what he was up to, Matt," put in McGlory,
"and hit the high places for here. Arrived just in time
to see Le Bon go out between the edge of the wall and
the edge of the tent top. Sufferin' skyrockets, but it was
quick! Everybody rushed at Rajah, and Carl was right
in the thick of it. I thought he'd be smashed into a
cocked hat before I could get hold of him."</p>

<p>"Who vas der feller vat left dot pucket oof vater in
der vay?" grumbled Carl, mopping his tow hair with a
red cotton handkerchief. "Id vas righdt under me ven I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
come down. I don'd like dot. Id vas pad enough mitoudt
any fancy drimmings in der vay oof a pail oof
vater."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a lesson for you to leave Rajah alone."</p>

<p>"T'anks, I know dot. Oof he vas der only elephant
vat dere iss, I vouldn't haf nodding to do mit him. Vile
I'm vaiding for dot fordune to come from India I haf
got to lif, but I vill shdarve pefore I dry to make a lifing
taking care oof Racha. Br-r-r, you old sgoundrel!" and
Carl turned and shook his fist at Rajah.</p>

<p>Just at this moment Boss Burton stepped up to Matt
and his friends.</p>

<p>"Here's a hard-luck proposition!" he glowered. "My
biggest elephant raises Cain in a way he never did while
Ben Ali had charge of him. Ben Ali was a villain, but
he knew how to manage elephants. But Rajah goes in
the parade, you can bet your pile on <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>"You don't mean it, Burton!" cried Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't I?" and there was a resolute gleam in the
showman's eyes as he faced Matt. "You watch and
see," he added.</p>

<p>"You're taking a lot of chances if you stick to that
notion," grunted McGlory. "The brute's liable to smash
a few cages and let loose a lion or two. By the time you
foot the bill, Burton, you'll find you're riding a mighty expensive
hobby."</p>

<p>"Rajah goes in the parade," shouted the angry showman,
"or I put a bullet into him. I've got my mad up
now."</p>

<p>"Who'll take him?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"If I can't find any one to put him through his paces,
by gorry I'll do it myself!"</p>

<p>"Then the Big Consolidated," said McGlory, "might
as well look for another boss."</p>

<p>"See here, Burton," went on Matt, "you've been having
the aëroplane tag your string of four elephants during
the parade, and Rajah's been at the end of the string and
right in front of the flying machine. You've got to give
the machine another place. I'll not take chances with it,
if Rajah's in the march. You ought to remember what
a close call the brute gave us in Lafayette."</p>

<p>"Nobody's going to change places in the parade!" declared
Burton.</p>

<p>He was a man of mercurial temperament, and could
only be managed by firmness.</p>

<p>"Either Rajah stays out of the procession," exclaimed
Motor Matt calmly, "or the <i>Comet</i> does."</p>

<p>"And you can paste that in your hat, Burton," added
McGlory. "What Pard Matt says goes."</p>

<p>"Oh, hang it," growled Burton, coming to his senses;
"if you fellows bear down on me like that, of course you
win out; but I hate to have a measly elephant butt into
my plans and make me change 'em. Now&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Say, Mr. Burton," spoke up a canvasman, stepping
to the showman's side and touching his arm, "there's a
dark-skinned mutt in a turban what wants ter see ye in
the calliope tent."</p>

<p>Burton whirled on the canvasman.</p>

<p>"Dark skinned man in a turban?" he repeated. "Does
he look like a Hindoo?"</p>

<p>"Dead ringer for one."</p>

<p>"Maybe it's Ben Ali&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, he ain't. I know Ben Ali, and this ain't him."</p>

<p>"That tin horn won't show up among these tents in a
hurry, Burton," said McGlory. "He knows he'll get
what's coming, if he does."</p>

<p>"Then," continued Burton, "it's dollars to dimes it's
Aurung Zeeb."</p>

<p>"Not him, neither," averred the canvasman. "This
bloke wears a red tablecloth and carries a basket. Looks
ter me like he had somethin' he wanted ter sell."</p>

<p>"I'll go and talk with him. Come on, Matt, you and
McGlory."</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and Carl followed the showman under
the canvas and into the calliope "lean-to." Here there
was a chocolate-colored individual answering the canvasman's
description. But he was not wearing the red tablecloth.
Instead, he had spread it on the ground and was
sitting on it. In front of him was a round, flat-topped
basket, and in his hands was a queer-looking musical
instrument.</p>

<p>"You want to see me?" demanded the showman, as
he and the boys came to a halt in front of the Hindoo.</p>

<p>The latter swept his eyes over the little group.</p>

<p>"You Burton Sahib?" he inquired, bringing his gaze
to a rest on the showman.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>"You look, see what I can do?" queried the Hindoo.</p>

<p>"If you've got something you want to sell&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The honorable sahib makes the mistake. <i>Dekke!</i>"</p>

<p>Then, with this native word, which signifies "look," the
Hindoo dropped his eyes to the round, flat basket and
brought the end of the musical instrument to his lips.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BURTON'S LUCK.</p>


<p>While the notes of the gourd flute echoed through the
tent, the cover of the round basket began to quiver and
shake. Finally it slipped back, and there were startled exclamations
and a brisk, recoiling movement on the part of
the spectators as the head of a venomous cobra showed
itself.</p>

<p>"A snake charmer!" muttered Burton, disappointment
in his voice. "They're as common as Albinos&mdash;and about
as much of a drawing card."</p>

<p>"That's a cobra di capello he's working with," remarked
Matt, staring at the snake with a good deal of
interest. "I saw one in a museum once, and heard a lecturer
talk about it. The lecturer said that the bite of a
cobra is almost always fatal, and that there is no known
antidote for the poison; that the virus works so quickly
it is even impossible to amputate the bitten limb before
the victim dies."</p>

<p>"Shnakes iss pad meticine," muttered Carl, "und I
don'd like dem a leedle pit."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' rattlers!" exclaimed McGlory. "I've been
up against scorpions, Gila monsters, and tarantulas, but
blamed if I ever saw a snake in a sunbonnet before&mdash;like
that one."</p>

<p>The cobra's hood, which was fully extended, gave it
the ridiculous appearance of wearing a bonnet, and there
was something grewsome in the way the reptile's head
swayed in unison with the flute notes. Suddenly the head
darted sideways.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's quickness alone kept him from being
bitten. He leaped backward, just in the nick of time to
avoid the darting fangs. McGlory, wild with anger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
picked up an iron rod that was used about the calliope
and made a threatening gesture toward the snake.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" he breathed. "What kind
of a snake tamer are you, anyhow? If you think we're
going to stand around and let that flat-necked poison
thrower get in its work on us, you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The cowboy made ready to use the rod, but Matt
caught his arm.</p>

<p>"Hold up, Joe," said Matt. "No harm has been done,
and this is a mighty interesting performance."</p>

<p>"Aber der sharmer don'd vas aple to put der shnake to
shleep mit itseluf," demurred Carl. "Der copra don'd
seem to like der moosic any more as me."</p>

<p>"Probably the snake's fangs have been pulled," put in
Burton. "I know the tricks of these snake fakirs."</p>

<p>"He got very good fangs, sahib," declared the Hindoo,
dropping the flute and getting up. "He pretty bad snake,
hard to handle. Now, watch."</p>

<p>Leaning forward, the Hindoo made a quick grab and
caught the snake about the neck with one hand. After
whirling it three times around his head, he let it fall on
the earth in front of him. To the surprise of the boys
and Burton, the cobra lay at full length, rigid and stiff,
and straight as a yardstick.</p>

<p>The serpent charmer then walked around the cobra,
singing a verse of Hindustani song.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"La li ta la, ta perisi,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La na comalay ah sahm-re,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Madna, ca-rahm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ram li ta, co-co-la lir jhi!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">La li ta la, vanga-la ta perisi."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Jupiter!" exclaimed Burton. "I've heard the Bengal
girls chant that song when they went to the well, of an
evening, with their water pitchers on their heads. That's
the time I was in India after tigers."</p>

<p>"<i>Dekke!</i>" cried the Hindoo; "I have killed my snake,
my beautiful little snake! But I have a good cane to
walk with."</p>

<p>Then, taking the rigid reptile up by the tail, he pretended
to walk with it.</p>

<p>"How you like to buy my cane, sahib?" he asked,
swinging the cobra up so that its head was close to the
young motorist's breast.</p>

<p>Matt shook his head and stepped quickly back.</p>

<p>"Take the blasted thing away!" snarled McGlory.
"Don't get so careless with it."</p>

<p>"The snake's hypnotized," explained Burton. "When
he swung it around his head he put it to sleep."</p>

<p>The Hindoo smiled; then, thrusting the head of the
rigid snake under his turban, he pushed it up and up
until all but the tip of the tail had disappeared under the
headdress. After that, with a quick move, he snatched
off the turban. The venomous cobra was found in a glittering
coil on his head.</p>

<p>With both hands the Hindoo lifted the drowsy cobra
from his head, dropped it into the basket, closed the lid,
and pushed the peg into place.</p>

<p>"That's a pretty good show," remarked Burton, "but
it's old as the hills. Where did you come from?"</p>

<p>"Chicago," replied the snake charmer. "I want a job
with Burton Sahib."</p>

<p>"What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Dhondaram."</p>

<p>"There's not a thing I can give you to do in the big
show," said Burton, "but maybe the side show could find
a place for you. Snake charmers are side-show attractions,
anyhow."</p>

<p>Dhondaram was giving most of his attention to Matt,
although speaking with Burton.</p>

<p>"He acts as though he knew you, pard," observed McGlory.</p>

<p>Dhondaram must have caught the words, for instantly
he shifted his gaze from Matt to the showman.</p>

<p>"Burra Burton can't give me a job in the big show?"
he went on.</p>

<p>"No," was Burton's decisive reply. "You're a Hindoo.
Tell me, do you know a countryman of yours named Ben
Ali?"</p>

<p>Dhondaram shook his head.</p>

<p>"Or Aurung Zeeb?"</p>

<p>Another shake of the head. Dhondaram, seemingly in
much disappointment, gathered up his scarlet robe and
his basket and started out.</p>

<p>"Know of any one who can handle an elephant?" Burton
called after him.</p>

<p>Dhondaram whirled around, his eyes sparkling.</p>

<p>"I handle elephants, sahib," he declared.</p>

<p>"You can?" returned the showman jubilantly. "Well,
this is a stroke of luck, and no mistake. Are you good
at the job?"</p>

<p>"Good as you find," was the complacent response.</p>

<p>"This elephant's a killer," remarked the showman cautiously.</p>

<p>"He can't kill Dhondaram, sahib," said the Hindoo,
with a confident smile.</p>

<p>"He has just been in a tantrum, and threw one man
through the tent."</p>

<p>"The elephant, when he is mad, must be looked after
with knowledge, sahib."</p>

<p>"Well, you come on, Dhondaram, and we'll see how
much knowledge you've got."</p>

<p>Dhondaram dropped in behind Burton, and Matt and
his friends fell in behind Dhondaram. Together they
repaired to the animal tent.</p>

<p>"Don't like the brown man's looks, hanged if I do,
pard," muttered McGlory.</p>

<p>"Me, neider," added Carl. "He iss like der shnake,
I bed you&mdash;ready to shtrike ven you don't exbect dot.
Aber meppy he iss a goot hand mit der elephant. Ve
shall see aboudt dot."</p>

<p>When they were back in the animal tent, Burton and the
boys found Rajah still in vicious mood. Straining at his
chains, the big brute was swaying from side to side,
reaching out with his trunk in every direction and trying
to lay hold of something.</p>

<p>"<i>Himmelblitzen</i>, vat a ugly feller!" murmured Carl,
standing and staring. "He vouldt schust as soon kill
somepody as eat a wad oof hay. You bed my life I vas
gladt I gave oop trying to manach him."</p>

<p>"There's the elephant, Dhondaram," spoke up Burton,
pointing. "He's a killer, I tell you, and I'll not be responsible
for damages."</p>

<p>"I myself will be responsible, sahib," answered the Hindoo.
"Hold my basket, sahib?" he asked, extending the
receptacle toward Carl.</p>

<p>Carl yelled and jumped back as though from a lighted
bomb.</p>

<p>"Nod for a millyon tollars!" he declared. "Take id
avay."</p>

<p>Dhondaram smiled and placed the basket on the
ground; then over it he threw the red robe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span></p>

<p>"<i>Dekke</i>, sahibs," he remarked, taking a sharp-pointed
knife from a sash about his waist. "Look, and you will
see how I manage the elephant in my own country."</p>

<p>Fearlessly he stepped forth and posted himself in front
of Rajah. It may be that the angry brute recognized
something familiar in the Hindoo's clothes, for he stopped
lurching back and forth and watched the brown man.</p>

<p>"You got to be brave, sahibs," remarked the Hindoo,
keeping his eyes on the elephant's. "If you have the
fear, don't let the elephant see. The elephant is always a
big coward, and he make trouble only when he think he
got cowards to deal with. Watch!"</p>

<p>With that, Dhondaram stepped directly up to the big
head of Rajah. Up went the head, the trunk elevated
and curved as though for a blow.</p>

<p>Matt and his friends held their breath, for it seemed
certain the brown man would be crushed to death under
their very eyes.</p>

<p>But he was not. Rajah's trunk did not descend. In
a sharp, authoritative voice Dhondaram began talking in
his native tongue. Every word was accompanied by a
sharp thrust of the knife.</p>

<p>The huge bulk of the elephant began to shiver and to
recoil slowly, releasing the pull on the chains. Presently
the big head lowered and the trunk came down harmlessly.</p>

<p>Then, at a word from the Hindoo, the elephant knelt
lumberingly on his forward knees, stretching out his
trunk rigidly. Dhondaram stepped on the trunk and was
lifted, gently and safely, to the broad neck. At another
word of command, Rajah rose, and Dhondaram, from his
elevated place, smiled and saluted.</p>

<p>"It is easy, sahibs," said he. "This elephant is not a
bad one."</p>

<p>Burton clapped his hands.</p>

<p>"Do you want a job as Rajah's <i>mahout</i>?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>The showman turned to Matt.</p>

<p>"Are you willing to take the <i>Comet</i> in the parade with
Rajah," he inquired, "now that we have a better driver
than even Ben Ali to look after the brute?"</p>

<p>"Dhondaram is a marvel!" exclaimed Matt. "Yes,
Burton, we'll be in the parade with the aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Good! Hustle around and get ready. There's not
much time. Come down, Dhondaram, and get the blankets
on Rajah. The parade will start in half an hour."</p>

<p>The boys hurried out of the tent and into the calliope
"lean-to." The <i>Comet</i> had to be put in readiness, and
McGlory and Ping, the Chinese boy, had costumes to
put on.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MOTOR MATT'S COURAGE.</p>


<p>During the exhibition at Lafayette, Indiana, the <i>Comet</i>
had caught fire while in the air and the king of the motor
boys had made a dangerous descent in safety. The machine
had been damaged, however, and, when the show
left the town, Matt and his friends had remained behind
to make repairs. These repairs had occupied two
days. When they were finished, Matt and McGlory had
rejoined the show, flying from Lafayette in the aëroplane
and scattering Burton's handbills over the country
as they came. Carl Pretzel and Ping, the Chinaman,
had caught up with the show by train, there being no
place for them on the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>The flight through the air had been made in the face of
a tolerably stiff breeze, and Matt and McGlory had found
it necessary to lie over almost the entire night on account
of a high wind. The flying machine, however,
had caught up with the show that very morning.</p>

<p>The Big Consolidated had pitched its tents in the outskirts
of Jackson, Michigan, just across the railroad
tracks on the road to Wolf Lake.</p>

<p>Matt's work, for which he and his friends were receiving
five hundred and fifty dollars a week, was to drive the
aëroplane, under its own power, in the parade, and to give
two flights daily on the grounds&mdash;one immediately after
the parade and the other before the evening performance&mdash;wind
and weather permitting. During these flights
Archie Le Bon was carried up on a trapeze under the
flying machine.</p>

<p>When the boys reached the place where the aëroplane
had been left in charge of Ping, they began at once replenishing
the gasoline and oil tanks and seeing that everything
was shipshape for the journey on the bicycle
wheels.</p>

<p>Ping, while primarily one of the <i>Comet's</i> attendants,
had also shown a decided regard for the steam calliope.
The calliope operator was teaching him to play a tune on
the steam sirens, in return for which attention the Chinaman
always provided the musical instrument with the
water necessary to make the steam that operated the
whistles.</p>

<p>Knowing that he would have to look after the aëroplane,
Ping had performed his calliope duties early in
the day.</p>

<p>The arrival of Carl with Matt and McGlory was a distinct
disappointment to Ping. He and the Dutch boy had
had a set-to at the time of their first meeting, and, although
Matt had made them shake hands, yet there still
rankled in their bosoms a feeling of hostility toward each
other. Nevertheless, they kept this animosity in the
background whenever Matt or McGlory was near them.</p>

<p>During the trip from Lafayette to Jackson on the
train the two had ridden in different cars. They were
not on speaking terms when away from Matt King and
his cowboy pard.</p>

<p>Carl was just beginning his engagement with the Big
Consolidated. He was traveling with the show while
waiting for some money to reach him from India. There
was nothing for him to do about the <i>Comet</i>, so he secured
a job playing the banjo in the side show while a
so-called Zulu chief performed a war dance on broken
glass in his bare feet.</p>

<p>When the flying machine was in readiness the wagons
and riders were already forming for the parade.</p>

<p>"You'll have to hustle to get into your clothes, Joe,"
said Matt, "you and Ping. Get a move on, now. While
you're away I'll watch the <i>Comet</i>."</p>

<p>McGlory and Ping started at once for the calliope tent,
which they used as general rendezvous and dressing
room. They rode on the machine in costume&mdash;McGlory
in swell cowboy regalia and Ping in a barbaric get-up that
made him look as though he had tumbled off a last year's
Christmas tree.</p>

<p>Carl had nothing to do until after the aëroplane flight,
and so he remained with Matt until the procession started.</p>

<p>"Here comes dot pad elephant, Racha," murmured
Carl, pointing to the string of four elephants lumbering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
in their direction from the animal tent. "Der Hintoo iss
pooty goot ad bossing der elephant, aber I don'd like his
looks."</p>

<p>"He's all right, Carl," laughed Matt easily. "It's
Rajah's looks you don't like."</p>

<p>"Vell, I dell you somet'ing, bard. Oof der elephant
geds his madt oop, all you got to do is to turn some veels
und sail indo der air mit der <i>Gomet</i>."</p>

<p>"We couldn't do that. When the <i>Comet</i> takes to the
air she has to have a running start. There's no chance
for such a start while we're in the parade."</p>

<p>"So? Vell, keep your eyes shkinned bot' vays und look
oudt for yourseluf. I got some hunches alretty dot you
vill haf drouples."</p>

<p>"We'll not have any trouble," returned Matt confidently.</p>

<p>A few minutes after the elephants had dropped into
line in front of the aëroplane, McGlory, his big spurs
clinking at his heels, and Ping, rattling with tin ornaments
and spangles, ran toward the <i>Comet</i>. Ping was
helped to the upper wing, and Matt and McGlory took
their places in the seats on the lower plane.</p>

<p>Carl drew off and cast a gloomy look at Ping, sitting
cross-legged on the overhead plane and languidly beating
the air with a fan.</p>

<p>"You look like nodding vat I efer see!" whooped Carl,
envious to a degree that brought out the sarcastic words
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"My see plenty things likee Dutchy boy when my no
gottee gun," chattered Ping.</p>

<p>"Py shinks," rumbled Carl, beside himself, "I vill make
you eat dose topacco tags vat you haf on!"</p>

<p>"Makee tlacks," answered Ping, with a maddening
wave of the fan; "makee tlacks to side show and plingee-plunk
for Zulu man! My makee lide in procesh."</p>

<p>The Chinaman's lordly way worked havoc with Carl's
nerves. He howled angrily and rushed forward. At
just that moment the parade got under way, and the aëroplane
lurched and swayed across the ground toward the
road.</p>

<p>"Carl," cried Matt sternly, "keep away!"</p>

<p>The Dutch boy had to content himself with drawing
back, shaking his fist at the glittering form on the upper
wing of the aëroplane, and saying things to himself.</p>

<p>The parade was but a wearying repetition of the many
Matt, McGlory, and Ping had already figured in. The
glitter of tinsel, the shimmer of mirrors, the prancing
steeds and their mediæval riders, the funny clowns, the
camels and elephants, and the blare of the bands had long
since lost their glamour. For Matt and his friends the romance
had died out, and they were going about their
work on a business basis.</p>

<p>The motor boys and their gasoline air ship always commanded
attention and were loudly cheered. The fame of
Motor Matt's exploits had been told in handbills and
dodgers by the clever showman, and, too, Burton had
seen to it that the young motorist secured ample space in
the newspapers. This, naturally, aroused a great deal of
interest, and it had long ago been conceded that Burton's
greatest attractions were Matt and his aëroplane.</p>

<p>Rajah was a very good elephant during the entire
parade. As usual, his mate, Delhi, marched ahead of
him, and always had a pacifying effect. Dhondaram,
perched on Rajah's neck, kept the huge brute lumbering
in a straight line.</p>

<p>But it seemed strange to Matt and McGlory that Rajah,
after his fit of madness, could be so suddenly brought into
subjection.</p>

<p>"I'll bet my spurs," remarked McGlory, early in the parade,
"that Rajah will cut up a caper yet."</p>

<p>"If he does," answered Matt, "I hope the <i>Comet</i> will
be out of his way. But this Dhondaram, Joe, seems to
be an A One <i>Mahout</i>, and I believe he can hold Rajah
down."</p>

<p>It was about half-past eleven when the dusty paraders
began filing back into the show grounds, the cages pulling
into the menagerie tent, the riders taking their horses
to the stable annex, and Matt driving the aëroplane to the
spot from which the first exhibition flight of the day
was to be made.</p>

<p>"You and Ping go and peel off your show togs," said
Matt to McGlory, as soon as the <i>Comet</i> had been brought
to a halt and he and his friends had dropped off the machine,
"and then come back and take charge of the start.
I've got to fix that electric wiring, or I'll get short-circuited
while I'm up with Le Bon."</p>

<p>He pulled off his coat while he was speaking, and
dropped coat and hat on the ground; then, as McGlory
and Ping made their way toward the calliope tent through
a gathering throng of sightseers, the young motorist
opened a tool box and stepped around toward the rear of
the aëroplane to get at the battery and adjust the connections.</p>

<p>A sharp tent stake, carelessly dropped by one of the
show's employees, lay in the way and Matt kicked it
aside. He gave a look around, and saw that Dhondaram
was having some trouble getting Rajah into the menagerie
tent. Thinking nothing of this, Matt proceeded to
the rear of the planes and threw himself across the lower
wing, close to the motor and the battery.</p>

<p>While he was busily at work he heard a series of
startled yells, apparently coming from the crowd that was
massing to witness the flight of the <i>Comet</i>. Withdrawing
hastily from his place on the lower plane of the machine,
Matt dropped to the ground and ran around the
ends of the right-hand wings. What he saw was enough
to play havoc with the strongest nerves.</p>

<p>Right and left the crowd was scattering in a veritable
panic, and through the lane thus made came Rajah, hurling
himself along in a direct line for the <i>Comet</i>. There
was no one on the animal's back, and the gay trappings
which covered him were fluttering and snapping in the
wind of his flight.</p>

<p>Rajah had always had a dislike for the aëroplane. Its
ungainly form seemed to annoy him. In the present instance
this was no doubt a fortunate thing. Had the
brute not kept his attention on the air ship, he might have
turned on the frightened throng and either killed or injured
a dozen people.</p>

<p>Motor Matt knew Rajah was charging the <i>Comet</i>, and
the lad's first impulse was to get out of the way; then, reflecting
that he and his friends stood to lose the aëroplane
unless he made a decided stand of some sort, he
caught up the tent stake, which lay near at hand, and
jumped fearlessly in front of the flying machine.</p>

<p>This move was not all recklessness on Matt's part.
He recalled what Dhondaram had said to the effect that
an elephant was a coward, and brave only when he had
cowardly human beings to deal with.</p>

<p>Well behind Rajah came a detachment of canvasmen,
carrying ropes and iron bars, and one armed with a rifle.
The king of the motor boys had seen these men, and he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
knew that if he could keep Rajah from his work of destruction
until the men had had time to come up the
<i>Comet</i> would be saved.</p>

<p>Cries of consternation went up from the spectators as
they saw the elephant plunge toward Matt. The lad gave
a fierce shout as the brute drew close, and waved the tent
stake.</p>

<p>"Get out of the way, King! Out of the way, or you'll
be killed!"</p>

<p>This was Burton's voice ringing in Matt's ears, and
coming from he knew not where. But the command had
no effect on the daring young motorist. He did not move
from his position.</p>

<p>Rajah wavered. Although he slackened his headlong
rush, he still continued to come on.</p>

<p>When he was close, and Matt could look into his
vicious little eyes, he halted, crouched back, and lifted
his trunk.</p>

<p>The lad jumped forward and began to use the pointed
end of the stake vigorously. Rajah's head was up, and
his sinuous trunk twined in the air.</p>

<p>The huge beast towered above Motor Matt like a
mountain, but the king of the motor boys held his ground.</p>

<p class="chaptitle">DHONDARAM'S EXCUSE.</p>


<p>What might have happened to Matt had not the canvasmen
arrived while he was pluckily facing and prodding
Rajah, it is hard to say. Certainly the young motorist's
brave stand held the elephant at bay and saved
the aëroplane. Before Rajah could make up his mind to
strike Matt down and trample over him to the <i>Comet</i>, the
frenzied brute was assailed on all sides and, under the
angry direction of Boss Burton, was beaten into a state
of sullen obedience.</p>

<p>"Where's that confounded Hindoo?" roared Burton,
as two of the other elephants hauled Rajah off toward
the animal tent.</p>

<p>McGlory, in his shirt sleeves, pushed through the crowd
and up to the aëroplane in time to hear the question.</p>

<p>"Dhondaram is up there in the calliope tent," said the
cowboy; "leastways he was a while ago. When Ping and
I dropped into the lean-to to change our togs, the Hindoo
was stretched on the floor, groaning like a man who
was having a fit. He didn't seem to be so terribly bad
off, in spite of the way he was taking on, and I didn't
have much time to strip off my puncher clothes and get
back here. Just as I got into my regular make-up, and
before I could take another look at Dhondaram, a fellow
ran by and yelled that Rajah was runnin' wild again and
headin' for the <i>Comet</i>. That was enough for me, and I
hustled hot foot for here. I saw you, pard," and here
the cowboy turned to Matt, "standing off that big brute
with a tent stake. Speak to me about that! Say, I'm a
Piegan if I ever thought you'd get out of that mix with
your scalp."</p>

<p>"It was a fool thing you did, King," growled Burton,
very much worked up over the way events had fallen out.
"You had about one chance in a hundred of getting out
alive. What did you do it for?"</p>

<p>"There wasn't any other chance of saving the <i>Comet</i>,"
answered Matt, a bit shaken himself now that it was all
over and he realized how close a call he had had.</p>

<p>"Your life, I suppose, isn't worth anything in comparison
with the value of this aëroplane," scoffed Burton.</p>

<p>"That sort of talk is foolish, Burton," said Matt. "I
remembered what Dhondaram had said about not being a
coward around Rajah, so I jumped in and got between
the elephant and the machine. But there's no use talking
now. The aëroplane has been saved, and there's
nothing much the matter with me."</p>

<p>"There <i>is</i> some use of talking," snapped Burton.
"Here comes Dhondaram, with Ping. Now we can find
out how Rajah got away. Dhondaram has starred himself&mdash;I
don't think. If that's the best he can do, on his
first try-out, I might as well give him the sack right
here."</p>

<p>The Hindoo and the Chinese boy were coming through
the excited crowd toward the aëroplane. Dhondaram
staggered as he walked, and there was a wild look in his
face.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with you, Dhondaram?" demanded
Burton sharply, as the eyes of the little group near the
<i>Comet</i> turned curiously on the Hindoo.</p>

<p>"I was sick, sahib," mumbled the brown man, laying
both hands on the pit of his stomach and rolling his eyes
upward.</p>

<p>"Sick?" echoed Burton incredulously. "It must have
come on you mighty sudden."</p>

<p>"It did, sahib. I came in from the parade, then all at
once I could not see and grew weak&mdash;<i>jee</i>, yes, so weak
I could not stay on Rajah's back, but fell to the ground
and lay there for a moment, not knowing one thing.
When I came to myself I was in a tent, and the <i>feringhi</i>
sahib,"&mdash;he pointed to McGlory&mdash;"and the Chinaman
sahib were getting clear of their clothes. When I get
enough strength, I come here. <i>Such bhat</i>, sahib. What I
say is true."</p>

<p>"You had Rajah properly tamed," went on Burton; "I
never saw him act better in the parade than he did this
morning. What caused him to make such a dead set
at this flying machine the moment you dropped off his
back?"</p>

<p>"Who can say, sahib?" asked Dhondaram humbly.
"He not like the machine, it may be. Has he a cause to
dislike the bird-wagon? The elephant, Burton Sahib,
never forgets. A hundred years is to him as a day when
it comes to remembering."</p>

<p>One of the canvasmen stepped up and asserted that he
had seen Dhondaram drop off Rajah's back and then get
up and reel away. Thereupon the canvasman, expecting
trouble, called for some of the other animal trainers, and
they picked up the first things they could lay hands on
and started after the charging elephant.</p>

<p>This was corroborative of the Hindoo's story, as was
also the statement made by McGlory.</p>

<p>"Are you subject to attacks like that?" queried Burton,
with a distrustful look at the new <i>mahout</i>.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sahib," replied the Hindoo glibly. "It was
the first stroke of the kind I have ever suffered. By
Krishna, I hope and believe it will be the last."</p>

<p>"Well," remarked Burton grimly, "if you ever have
another, you'll be cut out of this aggregation of the
world's wonders. Now hike for the menagerie and do
your best to curry Rajah down again."</p>

<p>Without a word Dhondaram wheeled and vanished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
into the crowd. McGlory turned, caught Matt's arm, and
pulled him off to one side.</p>

<p>"What's your notion about this, pard?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I haven't any," said Matt. "It's something to think
over, Joe, and not form any snap judgments."</p>

<p>The cowboy scowled.</p>

<p>"These Hindoos are all of the same breed, I reckon,"
he muttered, "and you know what sort of fellows Ben Ali
and Aurung Zeeb turned out to be."</p>

<p>Matt nodded thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"I don't believe one of the turban-tops is to be depended
on," proceeded McGlory. "They're all underhand
and sly, and not one of 'em, as I size it up, but
would stand up a stage or snake a game of faro if he got
the chance."</p>

<p>"There you go with your snap judgment," laughed
Matt.</p>

<p>"It's right off the reel, anyhow," continued McGlory
earnestly. "That Rajah critter was as meek as pie all
through the parade. It don't seem reasonable that he'd
take such a dead set at the <i>Comet</i> all at once. And, as
for Dhondaram getting an attack of cramps, he stood
about as much chance of that as of bein' struck by lightning."</p>

<p>Matt was silent.</p>

<p>"Blamed queer," continued McGlory, "that Ben Ali
and Aurung Zeeb should drop out, and then, two days
after, this other Hindoo should show up. For a happenchance,
pard, it's too far-fetched. There's something
rotten about it."</p>

<p>"What had Dhondaram got against the <i>Comet</i>?" asked
Matt.</p>

<p>"I pass that."</p>

<p>"You're hinting, in a pretty broad way, Joe, that the
new <i>mahout</i> deliberately set Rajah on to smash the aëroplane."</p>

<p>"Then I won't hint, pard, but will come out flat-footed.
That's just what I think he did."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"You've got to have a reason for everything? Well, I
haven't any reason for that, but I think it, all the same."</p>

<p>"Ping!" called Matt.</p>

<p>The Chinese boy was standing by the front of the aëroplane,
patting the forward rudders affectionately, looking
at the machine with a fond eye, and apparently exulting
over the fact that it had been saved from destruction.</p>

<p>At Matt's call, the boy whirled around and ran toward
his two friends.</p>

<p>"Whatee want, Motol Matt?" he asked.</p>

<p>"You came here with the Hindoo," said Matt. "How
was that?"</p>

<p>"My follow Hindoo flom tent. Him no gettee sick.
My savvy. When McGloly makee lun flom tent, Hindoo
jump to feet chop-chop, feel plenty fine. Him makee
play 'possum. Whoosh! When him come, my come,
too."</p>

<p>"Talk about that!" exclaimed McGlory. "Worse, and
more of it. There's a hen on of some kind, pard."</p>

<p>"Ping," proceeded Matt, "I've got a job for you."</p>

<p>"Bully!" cried the Chinaman delightedly.</p>

<p>"What I want you to do," said Matt, "is to watch
Dhondaram. Don't let him see you at it, mind, but just
dodge around, keep tab on him, and don't let him suspect
what you're doing."</p>

<p>"Hoop-ala!" said Ping, delighted at having such a
piece of work come his way.</p>

<p>"Think you can attend to that?"</p>

<p>"Can do! You bettee. My heap smarter than Hindoo.
You watchee, find um out."</p>

<p>"All right, then. Away with you."</p>

<p>Ping darted off toward the animal tent. At that moment
Burton hurried up.</p>

<p>"Better get busy and make your ascent, Matt," said
Burton. "The crowd's all worked up about that elephant
business, and the quickest way to get the people's minds
off it is by giving them something else to watch and talk
about."</p>

<p>"I'll start at once," replied Matt, taking his seat in his
accustomed place on the lower plane. "Let her flicker,
Joe."</p>

<p>The king of the motor boys "turned over" the engine,
switched the power into the bicycle wheels, and the
<i>Comet</i>, pushed by McGlory and half a dozen canvasmen,
raced along the hard ground for a running start.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">ROBBERY.</p>


<p>Motor Matt made as graceful an ascent and as pretty a
flight in the aëroplane as any he had ever attempted.
Archie Le Bon, swinging below the machine on a trapeze,
put the finishing touch to the performance by doing
some of the most hair-raising stunts. Loud and prolonged
were the cheers that floated up to the two with the
<i>Comet</i>, and there was not the least doubt but that the
aëroplane had successfully diverted the minds of the spectators
from the recent trouble with Rajah.</p>

<p>After the <i>Comet</i> had fluttered back to earth, and the
crowd had drifted away toward the side show, Matt and
McGlory left a canvasman in charge of the machine and
dropped in at the cook tent for a hurried meal. There
was now nothing for the two chums to do until the next
flight of the day, which was billed to take place at half-past
six.</p>

<p>"Did you ever have a feeling, pard," said the cowboy,
as he and Matt were leaving the mess tent and walking
across the grounds toward the calliope "lean-to," "that
there was a heap of trouble on the pike, and all of it
headed your way?"</p>

<p>"I've had the feeling, Joe," laughed Matt.</p>

<p>"Got it now?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Well, I have."</p>

<p>McGlory halted and looked skyward, simultaneously
lifting his handkerchief to test the strength and direction
of the wind. Watching the weather had become
almost a second nature with the cowboy since he and
Matt had been with the Big Consolidated. Aëroplane
flights are, to a greater or less extent, at the mercy of
the weather, and the more wind during an ascension then
the greater the peril for Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Think the weather is shaping up for a gale this afternoon,
Joe?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"Nary, pard. There's not a cloud in the sky, and it's
as calm a day as any that ever dropped into the almanac."</p>

<p>"Not exactly the day to worry, eh?"</p>

<p>"Well, no; but I'm worrying, all the same. What are
you going to do now?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>"Catch forty winks of sleep in the calliope tent. We
didn't get our full share of rest last night, and I'm feeling
the need of it."</p>

<p>When they got to the "lean-to" Matt laid a horse
blanket on the ground, close to the wheels of the canvas-covered
calliope, and stretched himself out on it. A band
was playing somewhere about the grounds, and the sound
lulled him into slumber.</p>

<p>The cowboy was not sleepy, and he was too restless to
stay in the "lean-to." Matt was hardly asleep before
McGlory had left on some random excursion across the
grounds.</p>

<p>A man entered the calliope tent. He came softly, and
halted as soon as his eyes rested on the sprawled-out
form of Motor Matt.</p>

<p>The man was Dhondaram. A burning light arose in
the dusky eyes as they continued to rest on the form of
the sleeper.</p>

<p>For some time the doors leading into the "big show"
had been open. Crowds were entering the menagerie
tent, and passing from there into the "circus top." The
noise was steady and continuous, so that it was impossible
for Matt, who was usually a light sleeper, to hear
the entrance of the Hindoo.</p>

<p>Dhondaram lingered for several minutes. He had not
his flat-topped basket with him, and he whirled abruptly
and hurried out of the "lean-to."</p>

<p>From the look that flamed in the face of the Hindoo
as he left, it seemed as though he was intending to return
again&mdash;and to bring the cobra with him.</p>

<p>He had not been gone many minutes, however, when
Boss Burton entered the calliope tent. This was where
he usually met the man from the ticket wagon, as soon
as the receipts had been counted and put up in bags,
received the money, and carried it to the bank. This part
of the work had to be accomplished before three o'clock
in the afternoon, as the banks closed at that hour. The
money from the evening performance always accompanied
Burton in the sleeping car on the second section
of the show train, and was deposited in the next town
on the show's schedule.</p>

<p>Burton did not see Matt lying on the ground, close up
to the calliope, and seated himself on an overturned
bucket and lighted a cigar. The weed was no more than
well started, when Dhondaram, carrying his basket, appeared
softly in the entrance. At sight of Burton, the
Hindoo stifled an exclamation and came to a startled
halt.</p>

<p>"What's wrong with you?" demanded the showman.</p>

<p>"Nothing at all, sahib," answered Dhondaram, recovering
himself.</p>

<p>"Feeling all right now?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sahib."</p>

<p>"Good!"</p>

<p>Without lingering for further talk, Dhondaram faced
about and glided away.</p>

<p>The conversation between the showman and the Hindoo
had awakened Matt. The young motorist sat up
blinking and looked at Burton. He knew how the proprietor
of the Big Consolidated always met the ticket
man in the calliope tent, about that time in the afternoon,
and checked up and received the proceeds for deposit in
the local bank.</p>

<p>"Much of a crowd, Burton?" called Matt.</p>

<p>"Oh, ho!" he exclaimed. "You've been taking a
snooze, eh?"</p>

<p>"A short one. Trying to make up for a little sleep I
lost last night. What time is it, Burton?"</p>

<p>"About half-past two. Say," and it was evident from
Burton's manner that the thought flashing through his
brain had come to him suddenly, "I want to talk with
you a little about that Dutch pard of yours."</p>

<p>"Go ahead," said Matt, leaning back against one of
the calliope wheels; "what about Carl?"</p>

<p>"Is he square?" continued Burton.</p>

<p>"Square?" repeated Matt. "Why, he's as honest a
chap as you'll find anywhere. If he wasn't, he wouldn't
be training with McGlory and me. You ought to know
that, Burton."</p>

<p>"You ain't infallible, I guess. Eh, Matt? You're
liable to make mistakes, now and then, just like anybody
else."</p>

<p>"I suppose so, but I know Carl too well to make any
mistake about <i>him</i>. What gave you the idea he was
crooked?"</p>

<p>"I never had the idea," protested Burton. "I just
asked for information, that's all. He came to the show
on your recommendation, and I've taken him in, but I like
to have a line on the people I get about me."</p>

<p>"There's more to it than that," said Matt, studying
Burton's face keenly. "Out with it, Burton."</p>

<p>"Well, then, I don't like the Dutchman's looks," acknowledged
Burton. "Ping told me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's it!" muttered Matt. "Ping told you&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Why, that he caught the Dutchman going through his
pockets last night. If that's the kind of fellow Carl is,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Take my word for it, Burton," interrupted Matt earnestly,
"my Dutch pard is on the level. He makes a
blunder, now and then, but he's one of the best fellows
that ever lived."</p>

<p>"What did Ping talk to me like that for?"</p>

<p>"He and Carl don't hitch. There's a little petty rivalry
between them, and they're a bit grouchy."</p>

<p>"Is Ping so grouchy that he's trying to make people
believe Carl's a thief?"</p>

<p>"Ping is a Chinaman, and he has his own ideas about
what's right and wrong. I'll talk to him about this,
though."</p>

<p>"You'd better. Certainly you don't want one of your
pards circulating false reports about another." Burton
looked at his watch impatiently. "I wonder where Andy
is?" he muttered, "He's behindhand, now, and if he
delays much longer, I'll not be able to get to the bank
before closing time."</p>

<p>"He may have had such a big afternoon's business,"
suggested Matt, "that it's taking him a little longer to
get the money counted, and into the bags."</p>

<p>"The business was only fair&mdash;nothing unusual. Andy
has had plenty of time to sack up the money and get here
with it."</p>

<p>Andy Carter was the ticket man. He was middle-aged,
an expert accountant, and was usually punctual to the
minute in fulfilling his duties to his employer.</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Dhondaram lately?" Matt
inquired casually.</p>

<p>"He blew in here with his little basket just before you
woke up. Didn't you see him?"</p>

<p>"I heard you talking," answered Matt, "and that's
what wakened me, but I didn't see who you were talking
with. Did he get Rajah under control again, Burton?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span></p>

<p>A puzzled look crossed the showman's face.</p>

<p>"He can manage that big elephant as easily as I can
manage a tame poodle, and he wasn't two minutes with
the brute before he had him as meek as Moses. What I
can't understand is how Rajah ever broke away and went
on the rampage like he did."</p>

<p>"There are others on this ground who deserve your
suspicions a whole lot more than my Dutch pard," observed
Matt.</p>

<p>"You mean that I'd better be watching Dhondaram?"</p>

<p>"Not at all," was the reply. Matt was already having
the Hindoo watched, so it was hardly necessary for Burton
to attend to the matter. "The Hindoo's actions are
queer."</p>

<p>"Hindoos are a queer lot, anyhow. But they're good
elephant trainers, and that's the point that gets me, just
now."</p>

<p>"Where did Dhondaram say he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Motor Matt got no further with his question. Just at
that moment a man reeled through the entrance. His
hat was gone, his coat was torn, and there was a bleeding
cut on the side of his face. With a gasp, he tumbled to
his knees in front of Burton.</p>

<p>"Great Jupiter!" exclaimed Burton, leaping to his feet.
"Andy! What's happened to you?"</p>

<p>"Robbed!" breathed the ticket man, swaying and holding
both hands to his throat; "knocked down and robbed
of two bags of money that I was bringing here. I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>By then the startled Matt was also on his feet.</p>

<p>"Who did it?" shouted the exasperated Burton. "Did
you see who did it? Speak, man!"</p>

<p>But Carter was unable to speak. Overcome by what
he had passed through, he crumpled down at full length
and lay silent and still at the showman's feet.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">BETWEEN THE WAGONS.</p>


<p>Excitement, and a certain reaction which follows all
such shocks as the ticket man had been subjected to, had
brought on a fainting spell. A little water soon revived
Carter, and he was laid on the blanket from which Matt
had gotten up a little while before.</p>

<p>"Now tell me about the robbery," said Burton, "and be
quick. While we're wasting time here, the thieves are
getting away. I can't afford to let 'em beat me out of
the proceeds of the afternoon's show. Who did it,
Carter?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, Burton," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Don't know?" repeated the showman blankly. "Can't
tell who knocked you down and lifted the two bags, when
it was done in broad day! What are you givin' us?" he
added roughly.</p>

<p>"It's a fact, Burton," persisted Carter. "I was hit
from behind and could not see the man who struck me."</p>

<p>"You've got a cut on your face. How do you account
for that if, as you say, you were struck from behind?"</p>

<p>"The blow I received threw me forward against a
wagon wheel. The tire cut my cheek. I dropped flat,
and didn't know a thing. When I came to myself, of
course, the money was gone."</p>

<p>"Here's a pretty kettle of fish, and no mistake!" fumed
Burton. "How much money did you have, Andy?"</p>

<p>"A little over eighteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>"Eighteen hundred gone to pot! By Jupiter, I
won't stand for that. Can't you think of <i>some</i> clue,
Andy? Pull your wits together. It isn't possible that a
hold-up like that could take place in broad day without
leaving some clue behind. Think, man!"</p>

<p>"Maybe that new Dutch boy could give you a clue,"
replied Carter. "He's a friend of Motor Matt's, isn't
he?"</p>

<p>"He's a pard of Matt's," said Burton, casting a significant
look at the king of the motor boys. "What makes
you think he might give us a clue? Don't hang fire,
Andy! Every minute we delay here is only that much
time lost. Go on&mdash;and speak quick."</p>

<p>"I had just left the ticket wagon," pursued Carter, trying
to talk hurriedly, "when the Dutchman stepped up to
me. He wanted a word in private, as he said, and I told
him he'd have to wait until some other time. He said
he couldn't wait, and that what he had to tell me was important.
I couldn't get away from him, and I agreed to
listen to what he had to say providing he didn't delay me
more than two or three minutes. With that, he led me
around back of the "circus top" and in between two canvas
wagons. That's when I got struck from behind."</p>

<p>Motor Matt listened to this in blank amazement. Boss
Burton swore under his breath.</p>

<p>"It's a cinch the Dutchman had a hand in the robbery,"
the showman declared. "He lured Andy in between the
wagons, and it was there that some of the Dutchman's
confederates knocked Andy down and lifted the bags. If
we can lay hands on this Carl, we'll have one of the
thieves."</p>

<p>"Don't be too sure of that," interposed Matt. "Carl
Pretzel never did a dishonest thing in his life, and I'm
sure he can explain this."</p>

<p>"Don't let your regard for the Dutchman blind you to
what's happened, Matt," warned the showman. "The
only thing he asked Andy to go in between the wagons
for was so that the dastardly work would be screened
from the eyes of people around the grounds." He turned
away, adding: "We'll have to hunt for Carl&mdash;and it will
be a hunt, I'll be bound. Unless I miss my guess, he and
his confederates are a good ways from here with that
eighteen hundred dollars."</p>

<p>Burton ran toward the tent door, followed by Matt. Before
either of them could pass out, Carl and McGlory
stepped through and stood facing them.</p>

<p>Carl had a red cotton handkerchief tied round the back
of his head.</p>

<p>"Here he is, by thunder!" cried the surprised Burton.</p>

<p>"So, you see," spoke up Matt, "he didn't run away,
after all."</p>

<p>"It's some kind of a bluff he's working," went on Burton
doggedly. "I want you," he added, and dropped a
heavy hand on Carl's shoulder.</p>

<p>"For vy iss dot?" inquired Carl.</p>

<p>"What do you want the boy for?" said McGlory.</p>

<p>"He helped steal eighteen hundred dollars the ticket
man was bringing over here for me to take to the bank,"
said Burton; "that's what I want him for."</p>

<p>"Iss he grazy?" gasped Carl, falling weakly against
McGlory. "Vat dit I do mit der money oof I took it,
hey? Und ven dit I take it, und vere it vas? By shinks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>"
and Carl rubbed a hand over his bandaged head, "I'm
doing t'ings vat I don'd know nodding aboudt. Somepody
blease tell me vat I peen oop to."</p>

<p>"Don't you get gay," growled Burton. "It won't help
your case any."</p>

<p>"Give me the straight o' this," demanded McGlory.</p>

<p>Burton stepped back and waved a hand in the direction
of Andy Carter.</p>

<p>"Look at Andy!" he exclaimed. "He's been beaten up
and robbed of two bags of money that he was bringing
here. The Dutchman lured him in between a couple of
canvas wagons, and that's where the job was pulled off."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about this!" murmured the dazed McGlory.
"What about it, Matt?" he added.</p>

<p>Matt did not answer, but stepped over to Carl.</p>

<p>"Why did you ask Carter to step in between the
wagons, Carl?" the young motorist asked.</p>

<p>"Pecause I vanted to shpeak mit him alone by himseluf,"
answered Carl. "Vat's der odds aboudt der tifference,
anyvay?"</p>

<p>"What did you want to speak with him about?"</p>

<p>"Vell, I don'd like blaying der pancho for dot Zulu
feller. I dit id vonce, und den fired meinseluf. Vat I
vant iss somet'ing light und conshenial&mdash;hantling money
vould aboudt suit me, I bed you. Dot's vat I vanted to
see der ticket feller aboudt. I vanted to ask him vould
he blease gif me some chob in der ticket wagon, und I
took him off vere ve could haf some gonversations alone.
Dot's all aboudt it, und oof I shtole some money, vere it
iss, und vy don'd I got it? Tell me dot!"</p>

<p>"That's a raw bluff you're putting up," scowled Burton.
"You're nobody's fool, even if you do try to make
people think so."</p>

<p>"I ain't your fool, neider," cried Carl, warming up.
"You can't make some monkey-doodle pitzness oudt oof
me. You may own der show und be a pig feller, aber I
got some money meinseluf oof it efer geds here from
Inchia, so for vy should I vant to svipe your money,
hey?"</p>

<p>"What happened between the wagons, Carl?" went on
Matt. "Just keep your ideas to yourself, Burton," he
added, "and don't accuse Carl until he has a chance to
give his side of the story. Did you see the man who
knocked Carter down?"</p>

<p>"I don'd see nodding," said Carl.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to say," asked Carter, rising up on the
blanket, "that I wasn't knocked down?"</p>

<p>"I don'd know vedder or nod you vas knocked down.
How could I tell dot?"</p>

<p>"You were there with Carter&mdash;there between the
wagons," cried Burton angrily. "Why shouldn't you have
seen what happened?"</p>

<p>"Look here vonce."</p>

<p>Carl pulled off his cap and bent his head.</p>

<p>"Feel dere," he went on, touching the back of his head.
"Be careful mit your feelings, oof you blease, und tell me
vat you findt."</p>

<p>"A lump," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Ouch!" whimpered Carl. "It vas so sore as I can't
tell. My headt feels like a parrel, und hurts all ofer.
Dot's der reason I ditn't see vat habbened. I vas knocked
down meinseluf, und it must haf peen aboudt der same
time der dicket feller keeled ofer."</p>

<p>"There you have it, Burton," said Matt, facing the
showman. "Carl wanted a job in the ticket wagon, and
thought he might get it by talking with Andy Carter.
When they got in between the wagons they were both
knocked down."</p>

<p>"Rot!" ground out Burton. "Why didn't Carter see
the Dutchman when he came to? Or why didn't the
Dutchman see Carter, if he got back his wits first?"</p>

<p>"Carl was looking for Carter when I met up with him,"
put in McGlory.</p>

<p>"The Dutchman wasn't near the wagons when I recovered
my senses," came from the ticket man.</p>

<p>"Und I don'd know vedder you vas dere or nod, Carter,"
explained Carl. "Ven I got to know vere I vas at,
I foundt meinseluf vanderin' around mit a sore headt.
But I tell you somet'ing, Burton. I peen a tedectif, und
a fine vone. How mooch you gif me oof I findt der
t'ieves und recofer der money? Huh?"</p>

<p>"I believe you know where that money is, all right,"
declared the showman, "and if you think I'm going to pay
you something for giving it back, you're wrong. If you
want to save yourself trouble, you'll hand over the funds."</p>

<p>"You talk like you vas pug-house!" said Carl. "I ain't
got der money."</p>

<p>"Who helped you steal it?"</p>

<p>"Nopody! I ditn't know it vos shtole ondil you shpeak
aboudt it."</p>

<p>"Stop that line of talk, Burton," put in Matt. "Carl's
story is straight, and it satisfies me."</p>

<p>"How much money did the Dutchman have when he
came here this morning?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"T'irty cents," replied Carl. "Modor Matt paid my
railroadt fare from Lafayette to Chackson."</p>

<p>"Search him, McGlory," ordered Burton. "Let's see if
he has anything about his clothes that will prove his
guilt."</p>

<p>Carl began to laugh.</p>

<p>"What's the joke?" snorted Burton.</p>

<p>"Vy," was the answer, "to t'ink I haf eighdeen huntert
tollars aboudt me und don't know dot. Go on mit der
search, McGlory."</p>

<p>Carl lifted his hands above his head, and the cowboy
began pushing his hands into Carl's pockets. In the second
pocket he examined he found something which he
pulled out and held up for the observation of all. It was
a canvas sack, lettered in black, "Burton's Big Consolidated
Shows."</p>

<p>"One of the bags that held the money!" exclaimed
Carter.</p>

<p>"I told you so!" whooped Burton.</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory were astounded. And so was Carl&mdash;so
dumfounded that he was speechless.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<p class="chaptitle">A PEG TO HANG SUSPICIONS ON.</p>


<p>"Vell, oof dot don'd grab der banner!" mumbled Carl,
when he was finally able to speak. "I hat dot in my
bocket und don'd know nodding aboudt it! Somepody
must haf put him dere for a choke."</p>

<p>"That's a nice way to explain it!" growled Burton. "It
cooks your goose, all right. Anything in the bag, McGlory?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nary a thing," answered the bewildered cowboy, turning
the bag inside out.</p>

<p>"Go on with the search," ordered Burton.</p>

<p>Mechanically the cowboy finished looking through the
Dutch boy's clothes, and all the money he found consisted
of two ten-cent pieces and a couple of nickels.</p>

<p>"Where did you hide that money?" demanded Burton
sternly, stepping in front of Carl.</p>

<p>"I don'd hite it no blace," cried Carl. "You make me
madt as some vet hens ven you talk like dot. Ged avay
from me or I vill hit you vonce."</p>

<p>"Carter," went on Burton in a voice of suppressed rage,
"call a policeman."</p>

<p>The ticket man had scrambled to his feet, and he now
made a move in the direction of the tent door.</p>

<p>"Hold up, Carter!" called Matt; then, turning to Burton,
he went on: "You're not going to arrest Carl, Burton,
unless you want this outfit of aviators to quit you
cold."</p>

<p>The red ran into Burton's face.</p>

<p>"Are you trying to bulldoze me?" he demanded. "I've
got eighteen hundred dollars at stake, and I'm not going
to let it slip through my fingers just because you fellows
threaten to leave the show and take the aëroplane with
you. I tell you frankly, King, I don't like the way you're
talking and acting in this matter. We've got good circumstantial
evidence against your Dutch friend, and he
ought to be locked up."</p>

<p>"I admit that there's some evidence," returned Matt,
"but you don't know Carl as well as I do. It isn't possible
that he would steal a nickel from any one. If there
was ten times as much evidence against him, no one could
make me believe that."</p>

<p>"You're allowing your friendship to run away with
your better judgment. What am I to do? Just drop this
business, right here?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. All I want you to do is to leave Carl
alone and let the motor boys find the thief."</p>

<p>"I want that money," said Burton, with a black frown,
"and I'm satisfied this Dutchman knows where it is."</p>

<p>"And I'm satisfied he doesn't know a thing about it,"
said Matt warmly.</p>

<p>"How did that bag get into his pocket?"</p>

<p>"If you come to that, why isn't there some of the stolen
money in the bag? Do you think for a minute, Burton,
that Carl would be clever enough to plan such a robbery,
and then be foolish enough to carry around with
him the bare evidence of it? You don't give him credit
for having much sense. Why should he keep the bag,
and then come in here with it in his pocket?"</p>

<p>Burton remained silent.</p>

<p>"Furthermore," proceeded Matt, "if Carl is one of the
thieves, or the only thief, why did he come in here at all?
Why didn't he make a run of it as soon as he got his
hands on the money?"</p>

<p>"Every crook makes a mistake, now and then," muttered
Burton. "If they didn't, the law would have a hard
time running them down."</p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I'll do," said Matt. "Leave Carl
alone. If I can't prove his innocence to your satisfaction,
I'll agree to stay four weeks with your show for
nothing. You'll be making more than two thousand dollars,
and you've only lost eighteen hundred by this robbery."</p>

<p>Burton's feelings underwent a change on the instant.</p>

<p>"Oh, well, if you put it that way," he said, "I'm willing
to let the Dutchman off. I only want to do the right
thing, anyhow."</p>

<p>"You vas a skinner," averred Carl contemptuously. "I
knowed dot from der fairst time vat ve met."</p>

<p>"Sing small, that's your cue," retorted Burton. "Remember,"
and he whirled on Motor Matt, "if you don't
prove the Dutchman's innocence, you're to work for me
for four weeks without pay. I'm willing to let it
rest in that way."</p>

<p>With that Burton took himself off. His show was
doing well and he was not pressed for funds. As for the
rest of it, he had shifted everything connected with the
robbery to the shoulders of Motor Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory was a bit dubious. He had not known Carl
as long as Matt had, and had not the same amount of
confidence in him.</p>

<p>"Matt," remarked the Dutch boy with feeling, "you vas
der pest friendt vat I efer hat, und you bed my life you
don'd vas making some misdakes ven you pelieve dot I
ditn't shdeal der money. I don'd know nodding aboudt
der pag, nor how it got in my bocket. Dot's der trut'."</p>

<p>"I know that without your telling me, pard," said Matt.
"The thing for us to do now is to find out who the real
thieves are."</p>

<p>"There must have been only one," said McGlory.</p>

<p>"There must have been two, Joe."</p>

<p>"How do you figure it?"</p>

<p>"Why, because both Carl and Carter were knocked
down at the same time. Neither saw what had happened
to the other. Two men must have done that."</p>

<p>"Vat a headt it iss!" murmured Carl. "Modor Matt
vould make a fine tedectif, I tell you dose."</p>

<p>"You've got a bean on the right number, pard, and
no mistake," exulted McGlory.</p>

<p>"Did you see any one near the wagons when you led
the ticket man in between them?" asked Matt, turning to
look at the place where he had last seen the ticket man
standing.</p>

<p>But Carter had left. Presumably, he had followed
after Burton.</p>

<p>"I don'd see nopody aroundt der vagons," answered
Carl. "Der t'ieves vas hiding, dot's a skinch. Day vas
hid avay mit demselufs in blaces vere dey couldt handt
Carter und me a gouple oof goot vones. Ouch again!"
and Carl rubbed a gentle hand over the red cotton handkerchief.</p>

<p>"Take us to the place where you and Carter were
knocked down, Carl," said Matt. "We'll look the ground
over and see if we can find anything."</p>

<p>The Dutch boy conducted his two friends toward the
rear of the circus tent. Here there were two big, high-sided
canvas wagons drawn up in a position that was
somewhat isolated so far as the tents of the show were
concerned. The wagons had been left in the form of a
"V," and Carl walked through the wide opening.</p>

<p>"Dis iss der vay vat ve come in," said he, "I in der
lead oof der dicket man. Ven I ged py der front veels
oof der vagon, I turn around, und den&mdash;<i>biff</i>, down I go
like some brick puildings had drowed demselufs on dop
oof me. Shiminy grickeds, vat a knock! I don'd know
vere Carter vas shtanding, pecause I ditn't see him, I vas
hit so kevick."</p>

<p>Matt surveyed the ground. The turf had retained no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
marks of the violent work. He examined the rear tires of
the wagons. The rims, for the whole of their circumference
that was off the ground, were covered with a coating
of dried mud; and this caking of mud was not broken
at any place.</p>

<p>"Carter must have stood here, in this position," observed
Matt, placing himself between the two rear wheels.
"He says that he fell against one of the wheels and cut
his cheek on the tire. I can't find any trace of the spot
where Carter came into such rough contact with either of
the tires."</p>

<p>"Don't you think he was telling the truth, pard?" asked
McGlory in some excitement. "Is it possible he was
using the double tongue, just to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Easy, there," interrupted Matt. "Carter was dazed
when he fell, and could hardly have known whether he
struck against the tire or against something else. He
may have dropped on a stone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No stones here," objected McGlory, with a quiet look
over the surface of the ground.</p>

<p>"Well, then it was something else that caused the injury
to his cheek. He&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Here's something," and McGlory made a dive for the
ground and lifted himself erect with an object in his
hand. "I reckon it don't amount to anything, though."</p>

<p>"Let's see it," said Matt.</p>

<p>McGlory handed the object to the young motorist. It
was a peg, perhaps half an inch thick by three inches
long, and had a knob at one end as big as a marble.</p>

<p>"Great spark-plugs!" exclaimed the king of the motor
boys, staring from the peg to McGlory and Carl.</p>

<p>"What's to pay?" queried McGlory. "You act as
though we'd found something worth while."</p>

<p>"We have," declared Matt, "and everything seems to
be helping us on toward a streak of luck in this robbery
matter."</p>

<p>"How vas dot?" queried Carl.</p>

<p>"This peg belongs to the Hindoo," said Matt. "It's the
contrivance he used for fastening down the lid of that flat
basket in which he carries the cobra."</p>

<p>McGlory went into the air with a jubilant whoop.</p>

<p>"He's the thief!" he cried. "I've had a feelin' all along
that he was a tinhorn. This proves it! Sufferin' blackguards,
Matt, but you've got a head!"</p>

<p>"Vere iss der shnake?" came from Carl, as he looked
around in visible trepidation. "Oof der pasket iss oben,
den der copra is loose on der grounds. Vat a carelessness!"</p>

<p>"And remember," said Matt, addressing the cowboy,
"that I had set Ping to watch the Hindoo before the robbery
took place. If Dhondaram is the robber, then Ping
was on his trail at the time and must know something
about it."</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" exulted the cowboy. "Our
friend the Hindoo has been putting in some good licks
since he joined the Big Consolidated! He hasn't let any
grass grow under his feet."</p>

<p>Motor Matt whirled around and walked out from between
the wagons.</p>

<p>"Let's find Ping," he called back, "and get a report
from him. That ought to settle everything."</p>

<p>McGlory and Carl, feeling that something important
was about to be accomplished, hurried after Matt as he
moved off across the show grounds.</p>




<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A WAITING GAME.</p>


<p>The Chinese boy was not in evidence anywhere about
the camp. After a search in all directions, Matt, McGlory,
and Carl, reasoning that Ping's trail had led him
to other places outside the show grounds, returned to the
calliope tent. There, to their overwhelming surprise,
they came upon Dhondaram, sitting nonchalantly on his
square of scarlet cloth and smoking a cigarette.</p>

<p>The Hindoo's face lighted up genially at sight of the
three boys.</p>

<p>"<i>Salaam</i>, sahibs!" said he in a friendly tone. "I come
here to rest. It is permitted? I thought so. Rajah takes
work to manage&mdash;<i>jee</i>, yes, much work. It tires me. Do
you use the little smokes? Take one, sahibs."</p>

<p>Dhondaram offered his little red box of rolled paper
poison, only to have his courtesy declined.</p>

<p>Matt was looking around. He was hoping to see the
basket, but it was not in sight.</p>

<p>McGlory had something at the end of his tongue, and
Carl was all agog with a desire to talk, but Matt silenced
each of them with a look.</p>

<p>"Where's the cobra, Dhondaram?" asked Matt. "I'd
like to see you juggle with the snake again."</p>

<p>The Hindoo smiled and showed his white teeth.</p>

<p>"<i>Maskee!</i>" he exclaimed, "that is my sorrow. My little
snake is gone. Now that I am taking care of elephants,
sahib, I have not the time to charm serpents. I
sold the cobra an hour ago."</p>

<p>"Sufferin' tarantulas!" murmured McGlory. "What
fool would want to buy a thing like that?"</p>

<p>"The cobra, sahib," said the Hindoo, turning to the
cowboy, "is a curiosity. Many <i>feringhis</i> like curiosities
and pay for them. 'Tis well. I like the elephants better
than the serpents."</p>

<p>"What did you do with the snake basket?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"That must be sold with the cobra, sahib. What would
the new owner do with the serpent unless he had the place
to keep him? <i>Dekke!</i> He take the snake, also he
take the basket. I throw in the basket, as you call&mdash;give
it as boot."</p>

<p>With eyes narrowly watching Dhondaram's face, Matt
produced the peg and tossed it on the red cloth.</p>

<p>"What did the new owner do," the king of the motor
boys inquired, "without the peg to keep the basket shut?"</p>

<p>Not a tremor crossed the Hindoo's face.</p>

<p>"Ah, ha!" said he. "I lose the peg and Motor Matt
Sahib find it. But it is nothing. There are many things
that can be used as pegs&mdash;a splinter, a bit of wood, almost
anything. Where you pick it up, sahib?"</p>

<p>"Oh, out on the grounds," answered Matt indefinitely.</p>

<p>"Sahib recognize the peg when he find him? You have
much observation, Mattrao Sahib."</p>

<p>The suffix "rao" is added to a name as a sign of great
respect. Probably Dhondaram felt that he was paying
Matt a high compliment, although, naturally, Matt knew
nothing about that.</p>

<p>Dhondaram got up slowly and lifted the red cloth
from the ground.</p>

<p>"I will now go," said he, "and find how my bad Rajah
is conducting himself. He must be watched carefully,
and spoken to."</p>

<p>With a courteous nod the Hindoo left the tent. As<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
soon as he was gone Matt rolled over and lifted one side
of the canvas wall.</p>

<p>The Hindoo, with never a look behind, walked in his
easy way around the calliope "lean-to" and into the "animal
top," by the front entrance.</p>

<p>"Nerve!" sputtered McGlory, "he's got a square mile
of it. Never turned a hair. Even the sight of that peg
didn't phase him."</p>

<p>Matt was still peering from under the canvas.</p>

<p>"There's something here I can't understand," said he,
a few moments later, and he dropped the canvas and
faced his friends.</p>

<p>"Vat it iss?" asked Carl.</p>

<p>"Why, we set Ping to watching Dhondaram, and by
all the rules of the game the Chinaman ought to be on
the fellow's track. But he isn't, so far as I can see.
What's become of Ping, McGlory?"</p>

<p>"Dhondaram has shaken him," hazarded the cowboy.
"The chink wasn't sharp enough for the turban boy."</p>

<p>"That may be," mused Matt, "although I doubt it. Ping
is about as smart a Chinaman as you'll find in a month's
travel. It's mysterious."</p>

<p>"Then again," went on McGlory, "maybe Ping is on
Dhondaram's trail and you don't know it. He's either
too wise for us, or else not wise enough for the Hindoo.
Pick out whichever conclusion you want."</p>

<p>But Matt shook his head, puzzled.</p>

<p>"He don'd vas mooch goot, dot chink feller," spoke up
Carl gloomily. "Vone oof dose days you will findt him
oudt."</p>

<p>"Don't try any slams on Ping," said McGlory. "He's
the clear quill, he is, even though he's a rat-eater and a
heathen. Ping has turned some pretty fine tricks for
Matt and me, and like as not he's busy coming across
with another. You've got too much of a grouch at the
slant-eyed brother, Carl."</p>

<p>"I say vat I t'ink, und dot's all," replied Carl. "I can
lick him mit vone handt tied aroundt my pack."</p>

<p>"Cut it out, Carl," said Matt. "Ping's a good fellow,
and has always stood by me. I don't want any hostile
feelings between two of my pards."</p>

<p>"Py shinks," cried Carl, "he iss more hosdyle at me as
I am at him. Aber he's a shink, und he hides vat he
t'inks pedder as I can do. Somedime you findt it oudt,
den you know."</p>

<p>"Go and look for Ping, Carl," said Matt. "Find him,
if you can, and bring him where I can talk with him. It's
more than likely that your innocence of that hold-up will
have to be proven by the Chinaman, so it will stand you
in hand to be friendly with him."</p>

<p>"Honest," fumed Carl, getting up, "I hat radder go to
chail mit meinseluf as to led der shink prove dot I ditn't
took der money."</p>

<p>"Well, you go and find him. You and Ping must be
friends if you're both to stay with me."</p>

<p>Carl was far from being in love with the task assigned
to him, but nevertheless he went off to do what he could
toward performing it.</p>

<p>"Those two boys don't mix worth a cent," remarked
Matt, when Carl had left. "They're like oil and water."</p>

<p>"They mix too much," grinned McGlory. "When they
got acquainted with each other it was a 'knock-down' in
more than one sense of the word. They've been hungry
to mix it up with each other ever since."</p>

<p>Matt had no answer for this. He was well acquainted
with the dispositions of both boys.</p>

<p>"When I first got acquainted with Carl," said Matt
reminiscently, "he was having trouble with a Chinese
laundryman. That was 'way off in Arizona."</p>

<p>For a time there was silence between the friends,
broken at last by the cowboy.</p>

<p>"What can we do now, pard?"</p>

<p>"It's a waiting game for us, and if Ping doesn't know
something that will help Carl out of the hole he is in,
we'll have to hunt for some other clues."</p>

<p>"Dhondaram is a smooth article, and no mistake. If
he really stole the money, who helped him? And why is
he staying with the show?"</p>

<p>"I don't know, pard," returned Matt. "We'll have to
let the thing work itself out, somehow."</p>

<p>"You don't intend presenting Burton with our wages
for a month, do you?"</p>

<p>"That's the very last thing I'd ever do!" declared Matt.</p>

<p>"Then, if that's the case, we can't keep up this waiting
game too long."</p>

<p>The afternoon performance was over, and the crowd of
people began filing out of the tents. Only the "grand
concert" remained, and that would soon be at an end, and
the time would arrive for another ascension with the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"I wish," remarked Matt thoughtfully, "that we could
work out this robbery business before we leave Jackson.
Some town crook may be mixed up in it with Dhondaram,
and when the show leaves the place we may all be
leaving the money behind."</p>

<p>"Burton isn't worrying," said McGlory. "He's positive
Carl is guilty, and that you can't prove anything else.
In other words, Boss Burton is planning to have us work
four weeks for nothing."</p>

<p>"He'll be disappointed," said Matt. "Let's go and get
supper, Joe. It won't be long before the evening crowd
begins to arrive, and I want to put the <i>Comet</i> in shape."</p>

<p>While they were eating at the long table in the mess
tent Carl came in.</p>

<p>"I don'd find nodding," said he, dropping wearily into
a chair. "Der shink is harter to find as a hayshtack mit
some neetles in it. Meppy he iss over in der town, or
else gone oop in a palloon, or else"&mdash;and here Carl leaned
closer to Matt and spoke in a whisper&mdash;"meppy he took
der money himseluf und has gone pack py Shina."</p>

<p>"That will do, Carl," said Matt sternly. "Ping is as
honest as you are."</p>

<p>"Anyhow," spoke up McGlory sarcastically, "he didn't
ask Carter to go between the wagons, and we didn't find
a bag in his pocket."</p>

<p>"Dot's righdt, rup id in," glowered Carl. "Oof I could
ged dot money from Inchia I vould fly der coop und I
vouldn't come pack any more. All der tedectif vat iss in
me say der shink is gone mit der show money. I say
vat I t'ink."</p>

<p>"Well," said Matt, "don't say it to anybody else."</p>

<p>When he and McGlory left the mess tent and moved off
toward the aëroplane, Carl was still eating.</p>

<p>Matt was counting upon having as successful a flight
that afternoon as he had made in the morning. The repaired
aëroplane was in better trim for flying than it had
been when new, and there was not even the small breeze
which had accompanied the first flight of the day.</p>

<p>But, if Matt could have known it, he was destined to
meet with one of the most desperate and hair-raising
exploits of his aëroplane career during that second flight
from the Jackson show grounds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A TRICK AT THE START.</p>


<p>The guard who had been in charge of the aëroplane
since the parade had returned to the show grounds was
relieved by Matt and McGlory. As soon as he had left,
Matt, in accordance with his usual custom, made a careful
examination of the machine. He knew very well
what might happen if he found, after being launched into
the air, that some of the many parts of the aëroplane were
loose, or the machinery not working properly.</p>

<p>Long ropes, stretched on each side of the road on which
the flying machine got its start, served to keep the people
back and to give Matt and his corps of assistants plenty
of room.</p>

<p>So far as the young motorist could see&mdash;and his investigation
was always thorough&mdash;the aëroplane was in
as serviceable a condition as it had been for the morning's
flight. It was a most ungainly looking machine
when resting on the ground, but was transformed into a
thing of grace the moment it spurned the earth and
mounted skyward.</p>

<p>"She looks as fit as a fiddle," remarked McGlory, his
face shining with pride.</p>

<p>"She'll do her work easy as falling off a log," said
Matt. "The repairs we made on her, in Lafayette, seem
to have been an improvement."</p>

<p>"We don't want to make any more improvements of
that sort," remarked McGlory, thinking of the accident
which had made the repairs necessary.</p>

<p>"Ah," cried Matt, "here comes Le Bon. And look
who's with him," he added in a lower tone.</p>

<p>The cowboy turned his head and swept his gaze over
the throng that pressed the guard rope to the north of
the road. Le Bon, in his trapeze costume, was crawling
through the press, and close behind him came Dhondaram.
McGlory scowled.</p>

<p>"What's the Hindoo coming for?" he muttered. "I'm
getting so I hate the looks of that fellow."</p>

<p>Le Bon came close, walking with the springy tread of
the trained athlete.</p>

<p>"It looks as though we were going to have as nice a
time aloft as we had this morning, Matt," he observed,
coming to a halt and taking a look at the sky.</p>

<p>"What's the Hindoo trailing you for?" queried McGlory.</p>

<p>"He wanted to come along and see the flight at close
quarters. He's a pretty good fellow, McGlory, and I
told him to push along with me. What's the harm?"</p>

<p>"No harm at all," interposed Matt hastily.</p>

<p>McGlory spun around on his heel and would not remain
near to talk with Dhondaram. The Hindoo, as he
halted in front of Matt, was smiling in his most ingratiating
manner.</p>

<p>"I have come to look, sahib," said he, "at your most
wonderful performance. It is read of everywhere, and in
Chicago most of all. It will be a pleasure. It is permitted?"</p>

<p>"You can stay here," answered Matt, "providing you
keep out of the way."</p>

<p>"I will see to that, Mattrao Sahib," and the Hindoo
walked around the aëroplane, giving it his respectful attention.</p>

<p>The wonder was growing upon Matt as to the whereabouts
of Ping. The Chinese boy was always on hand
when the flights were made, for the <i>Comet</i> was the apple
of his eye and he took it as a personal responsibility to
make sure that the "get-away" was always safely accomplished.</p>

<p>He did not appear to be trailing the Hindoo. If he
had been, why was he not somewhere in the crowds that
were pressing against the guard ropes.</p>

<p>"Watch the brown tinhorn, Le Bon," muttered McGlory,
in the kinker's ear, "and see that he don't tinker
with anything."</p>

<p>"Why," exclaimed Le Bon, "he wouldn't do anything
like that!"</p>

<p>"He might," was the sharp response. "I haven't any
faith in these fellows who wear a twisted tablecloth for a
hat. If anything should go wrong, up in the air, it'll spell
your finish as well as my pard's. I'm going to have a
word with Matt."</p>

<p>The band had come from the mess tent. Instruments
in hand, the members had climbed into the band wagon,
which was hauled up near the point from which the
<i>Comet</i> would start, and a rattling melody was going up
from the horns, the drums, and the cymbals.</p>

<p>The aëroplane flight was Motor Matt's own particular
part of the show. It was an instructive part, too,
for aside from the thrill of seeing a human being piloting
a big mechanical bird through the air the observers were
given the last word in aërial navigation.</p>

<p>"What's on your mind, pard?" asked McGlory, halting
at Matt's side. "You're as thoughtful as a cold game
gent who's looking into the open end of a gun."</p>

<p>"Have you seen anything of Ping, Joe?" said Matt.</p>

<p>"Chink 'signs' haven't been at all plentiful since our
squinch-eyed brother tried to run out the Hindoo's trail."</p>

<p>"I'd like to know where the boy is, that's all."</p>

<p>"Don't fret about him. I'd like to have a picture of
Ping in a corner he couldn't get out of. You take it
from me, Johnny Hardluck hasn't got such a corner in
his whole bag of tricks."</p>

<p>At that moment Burton rode up to the aëroplane on
his favorite saddler.</p>

<p>"Innocent or guilty?" he asked, leaning down from his
saddle and accompanying the words with a significant
wink.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p>"Innocent, of course," answered the king of the motor
boys.</p>

<p>"Can you prove it to me?"</p>

<p>"Not yet."</p>

<p>"And you never will. Better let me have the Dutchman
locked up. That'll scare him so he'll tell all he
knows, and maybe it isn't yet too late to get the money
back."</p>

<p>"Keep hands off my Dutch pard, Burton," said Matt.
"We've made an agreement about that."</p>

<p>"Exactly." Boss Burton straightened. "I guess you'd
better get a-going, Matt," he added. "The whole town
seems to be outside the guard ropes, and I don't think we
could get any more spectators if we waited all night."</p>

<p>Burton backed his horse away from the starting line
and lifted one hand. Instantly a breathless silence fell
over the vast throng, while every individual member of it
craned his or her neck to get a better view of what was
going on.</p>

<p>The aëroplane, as has already been stated, had to make
a running start on bicycle wheels in order to develop the
speed necessary for the wings to take hold of the air and
lift the machine. The wheels were low, and Le Bon had
to sit on the lower plane beside Matt and hold the trapeze
on his lap until the <i>Comet</i> was high enough for him to
drop from the footboard.</p>

<p>The <i>Comet's</i> motor was equipped with a magneto, but,
at the beginning and while the machine was on the
ground, the spark was secured with a make-and-break circuit.
When the motor was properly going the magneto
took hold and an automatic switch brought it into commission.</p>

<p>McGlory superintended the ground work during the
start. Some half a dozen men, under his direction,
ranged behind the planes, started the machine, and ran
with it. The power in the bicycle wheels soon carried the
aëroplane away from them.</p>

<p>At twenty-eight miles an hour the great wings felt the
tug of the air, the wheels lifted from solid ground, and a
sharp pull at a lever started the big propeller.</p>

<p>Matt had made so many ascensions that he handled
every part of his work with automatic precision, and the
aëroplane, amid the wild cheers of the crowd, darted skyward.</p>

<p>McGlory, standing perhaps a distance of fifty feet back
from the point where the machine left the earth, saw a
bag hanging to the under plane, close to an opening that
led up through the plane to the motor and the driver's
seat.</p>

<p>What was the bag? the cowboy asked himself, and how
did it chance to be swinging there?</p>

<p>McGlory had only a few moments to make his observations,
for the <i>Comet</i> was climbing swiftly upward
and the bag was growing rapidly smaller to the eye. He
ran forward, stumbling and looking, and Burton, evidently
with his eyes on the same object, galloped past him
with glance upturned.</p>

<p>Suddenly a black object appeared over the top of the
bag, grew longer, wriggled queerly, and could be seen
disappearing into the space between the two planes.</p>

<p>The cowboy halted his stumbling feet and reeled, his
brain on fire and his breath coming quick and hard.</p>

<p>That black, wriggling thing must have been the cobra!
The cobra, which the Hindoo had said he had sold to
some one on the show grounds!</p>

<p>McGlory's mind was a hopeless chaos of fears, doubts,
and wild speculations. While he stood there, Burton, a
wild look on his face, came galloping back.</p>

<p>"That bag!" he gasped, drawing rein with a quick,
nervous hand at the cowboy's side. "Did you see it, McGlory?"</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the other.</p>

<p>"It was one of the bags that had stolen money in it!"
declared Burton; "I saw the black lettering on the side!
Is it the one you got from the Dutchman?"</p>

<p>McGlory shook his head, still dazed.</p>

<p>"I've got that&mdash;in my grip&mdash;at the calliope tent," he
managed to gasp.</p>

<p>"Where did that one come from?"</p>

<p>Then McGlory came to his senses.</p>

<p>"I don't care a whoop about the bag, or where it came
from," he shouted. "Did you see that snake come out of
it and crawl up onto the lower plane? Did you see that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Don't talk to me! Find that Hindoo&mdash;he was here
before the start and he put that bag there. Find him!"
yelled McGlory.</p>

<p>Then, at the top of his lungs, the cowboy shouted frantically
to Matt, in the hope of letting him know his danger
and putting him on his guard.</p>

<p>But it was a fruitless effort. The tremendous cheering
drowned McGlory's voice, and it was impossible for him
to make his voice heard.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">IN THE AIR WITH A COBRA.</p>


<p>Both Motor Matt and Le Bon were delighted with the
start of the aëroplane.</p>

<p>"She gets better and better," averred Le Bon. "I guess
I'll take to flying myself."</p>

<p>While in the air Matt's every faculty of mind and
quickness of body were called into action. He had to
<i>feel</i> the motion of the air on the huge wings, as communicated
to the framework under him, and shift the
wing extensions back and forth to meet the varying resistance
of air pressure and make it coincide with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
centre of gravity. To withdraw his attention for an instant
from the work of managing the machine might result
in a disaster that would bring destruction to himself
and Le Bon. But he had schooled himself to talk while
keeping busy with his work.</p>

<p>"Better not try it, Archie," Matt answered. "It's too
much of a strain on a fellow's nerves. Are you ready to
drop with the trapeze?"</p>

<p>"Whenever you are," was the response.</p>

<p>There was always a jolt when Le Bon's weight reached
the ends of the trapeze ropes, and extra care was required
in taking care of the <i>Comet</i>.</p>

<p>Matt brought the air craft around in a sweeping circle
and headed the other way to cover the north and south
extent of the grounds. He, likewise, the moment the turn
was made, turned the aëroplane upward.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with McGlory?" asked Le Bon,
peering down. "He's looking up and waving his arms."</p>

<p>"He wouldn't do that," said Matt, "unless something
is wrong. When you get on the trapeze, Archie, look
over the under part of the machine and see if you can find
anything out of whack. I can't imagine what's gone
crosswise, for the aëroplane never behaved better."</p>

<p>Reaching the top of the airy slope, some two hundred
feet above ground, Matt pointed the machine earthward.</p>

<p>"Now's your time, Archie," he said to Le Bon.</p>

<p>The athlete stood erect, firmly clutching the trapeze bar,
and dived out into space. Swiftly Matt brought the craft
to an even keel, just as the whole fabric fluttered under
the jolt. In a twinkling the <i>Comet</i> righted herself, and
Le Bon was left swinging on his frail bar, a hundred
and fifty feet above the show grounds. His position under
the machine was such that Matt could not see him.</p>

<p>"All right, Archie?" shouted Matt, keeping his eyes
ahead and manipulating his levers incessantly.</p>

<p>"Right as a trivet," came up from below. "McGlory is
still throwing himself around down there."</p>

<p>"Do you see anything wrong with the machine?"</p>

<p>"Not a thing. What's that bag hanging under the
wing for?"</p>

<p>"Is there a bag there?"</p>

<p>"Yes, a canvas bag. There are letters on it. Wait,
and I'll read them."</p>

<p>There followed a silence during which, supposedly, Le
Bon was spelling out the letters.</p>

<p>"'Burton's Big Consolidated Shows'," went on Le Bon.
"That's what's printed on the bag, Matt."</p>

<p>"Great spark-plugs!" exclaimed Matt. "Anything in
the bag, Archie?"</p>

<p>"It's as limp as a rag and looks to be empty. How did
it get there?"</p>

<p>"Give it up. If it's empty, I don't see how it can do
any harm. I don't like the thoughts of the thing, though,
and we're not going to remain up as long as usual. Get
busy with your work."</p>

<p>Renewed cheering greeted the daring feats performed
on the trapeze by Le Bon. In the midst of it the motor
missed fire and died altogether. The slowing rotations
of the propeller caused the <i>Comet</i> to glide earthward. A
terrified yell broke from Le Bon.</p>

<p>"What's the matter, up there?"</p>

<p>"Keep your nerve," flung back the king of the motor
boys; "something's wrong with the motor&mdash;but we'll be
all right."</p>

<p>Yes, Matt knew that the aëroplane would glide earthward
and land him and Le Bon without injury; but, if it
could not be guided, it was as likely to land on the heads
of that dense crowd as anywhere. That would mean
serious, if not fatal, injury to many men&mdash;perhaps to
women and children.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's face went white, and his heart pounded in
his throat. Nevertheless he kept a cool head and a steady
hand.</p>

<p>He figured out the exact point where they would come
down. It was in the very thickest part of the crowd, and
the people were trying frantically to get out of the way.</p>

<p>Then, just as it seemed as though nothing could prevent
a terrible accident, the motor again took up its cycle
and the slowly whirling propeller increased its speed.</p>

<p>A long breath of relief escaped Matt's tense lips as he
drove the aëroplane upward and the direction of the
roped-off road.</p>

<p>"What ails the blooming motor?" came from Le Bon
in a distraught voice. "We came within one of killing a
lot of people. I'm all in a sweat."</p>

<p>"I don't know what's the matter with the motor," answered
Matt, "but I'm going to find out just as soon as I
turn to go back on the course."</p>

<p>"Better descend. This is more than I can stand."</p>

<p>"We can't descend until we reach the right place."</p>

<p>Matt made a wide turn, the engine working perfectly.</p>

<p>"Hold on tight, below there," he called. "I've got to
take my attention from running the motor for a moment,
and if we give a wild pitch or two don't be afraid. I'll be
able to keep the machine right side up."</p>

<p>"I'm pretty near all in," came from Le Bon in a subdued
voice, "but it would take an axe to chop me off this
trapeze."</p>

<p>Matt gave a quick look behind him. What he saw
nearly froze him with horror.</p>

<p>A cobra&mdash;undoubtedly the very snake he had seen in
the calliope tent&mdash;was twined about two of the electric
wires.</p>

<p>The wires, as originally strung, were an inch and a
half apart, and insulated. The coils of the six-foot cobra
encircled both. As the coils contracted the wires were
forced together, and two points of the copper, where the
insulating material was worn off, were brought in contact.
Thus a short circuit was formed and a bad leak
made for the electricity.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment Matt looked the coils of the cobra had
loosened, causing the tightly strung wires to spring a little
apart, thus restoring the spark to the cylinders. But
at any moment the coils might tighten again and cause
another short circuit.</p>

<p>As though to crown the terrors of the moment, the
cobra's head was lifted from the wires by a third of the
anterior length of its body&mdash;a favorite position assumed
by the cobra in gliding along the earth&mdash;and the diamond-like
eyes were fastened upon Matt with deadly animosity.</p>

<p>Motor Matt's one thought was this: If he were bitten
by the snake before he had manipulated a safe landing,
the swift working of the virus in his veins would keep
him from doing his duty in preventing injury to the spectators
below.</p>

<p>With white face and gleaming eyes, he turned from the
cobra and man&oelig;uvred to place the aëroplane lengthwise
of the roped-off space on the ground.</p>

<p>Before he could place the machine in proper position
the motor again commenced to miss fire, and then died all
over again. A groan was wrenched from Matt's lips as
the machine fluttered downward toward the massed
human heads underneath. The groan was echoed by
Le Bon.</p>

<p>"We're dropping toward them again!" yelled the man
below.</p>

<p>Matt turned in his seat, letting the aëroplane take care
of itself. Throwing himself back, he caught at the
hooded brown head with his hand.</p>

<p>There was a dart, quick as lightning, and Matt's wrist
was touched as though by a hot coal. With a loud cry he
flung his arm forward, dragging the full length of the
cobra from the wires.</p>

<p>For the fraction of an instant the snake hung in midair,
then yielded to the impetus of the arm to which it held
and coiled sinuously outward and downward into space.</p>

<p>The motor had again resumed its work, but the <i>Comet</i>
hung at a frightful angle and was dropping like so much
lead, the atmosphere striking the planes almost on their
edges.</p>

<p>Matt was calm, now, and cool as ever. He went to
work at the levers, righted the machine within fifteen feet
of the bobbing heads, and sent it upward into the air. He
was alone, for Le Bon, when so close to the ground, had
dropped. In fact, owing to the length of the trapeze
ropes, Le Bon's feet had almost swept the heads of the
terrified spectators.</p>

<p>Steadily upward climbed the machine.</p>

<p>Every moment was precious to the king of the motor
boys, for if he was to receive medical aid to counteract
the bite of the reptile, it could not be long deferred.</p>

<p>But what was the use of indulging in hope?</p>

<p>He had been bitten by the cobra, and the lecturer in
the museum had declared that a person so injured could
not hope.</p>

<p>Vaguely Matt wondered why the poison in his veins
had not already rushed to his brain and paralyzed him
into inaction. He was feeling as strong as ever, and as
able to effect a safe landing without danger to the people
on the show grounds.</p>

<p>That was the thing he had set out to accomplish, and
it was the thing he would do.</p>

<p>Freed of Le Bon's weight, the <i>Comet</i> was more manageable.</p>

<p>With steady hand and cool, unshaken judgment, he laid
the <i>Comet</i> parallel with the road, glided downward with
a rush, shut off the power, and touched the hard ground
squarely between the guard ropes.</p>

<p>The jar of the landing was hardly perceptible, and Matt
stepped out of the car, to be grabbed by McGlory and to
see Burton, dismounted and anxious, at his side.</p>

<p>"The cobra&mdash;&mdash;" began Matt.</p>

<p>"Killed," struck in Burton.</p>

<p>"Did it bite any one in the crowd?"</p>

<p>"No; every one was out of the way, and the fall itself
nearly did the business for the reptile."</p>

<p>"Then get a doctor for me," said Matt, showing a
trickle of blood on his wrist. "That's the cobra's mark."</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A SCIENTIFIC FACT.</p>


<p>For an instant, following Motor Matt's tragic announcement,
McGlory and Burton were stricken dumb
with horror. The cowboy was first to recover his wits,
and he leaped to the back of Burton's horse.</p>

<p>"Doctor!" he shouted, galloping madly along the road
between the ropes that separated the crowd; "we want a
doctor! Where's a doctor?"</p>

<p>In a crowd like that it was natural that there should be
many doctors, and no less than three forced themselves
through the throng, dived under the ropes, and hurried to
Motor Matt.</p>

<p>Among these three physicians was Doctor Horton, an
old man of no particular school, but widely read and
eminent in his profession.</p>

<p>"He'll die," said one of the medical men. "If that
snake was a genuine cobra, and if its fangs were not removed,
Motor Matt might as well make his will&mdash;and be
quick about it."</p>

<p>"My opinion exactly," said the other physician.</p>

<p>"Bosh!" answered Doctor Horton derisively.</p>

<p>The other two turned on him.</p>

<p>"What do you mean, Horton?" they demanded.</p>

<p>"Just what I say," was the response. "This brave lad,
who endangered his own life to save innocent spectators,
is as sound as a dollar this minute."</p>

<p>"Then the snake was not a cobra," averred one of the
others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>"It <i>was</i> a cobra," snapped Doctor Horton; "I saw it."</p>

<p>"Then its fangs had been pulled."</p>

<p>"They had not been pulled&mdash;I saw them, too."</p>

<p>"It is not possible, in that case, that the young man was
bitten."</p>

<p>"Not bitten?" cried Doctor Horton ironically, lifting
Matt's wrist, which he was holding. "Certainly he was
bitten, and by one of the most poisonous snakes of which
we have any knowledge. There's the mark, gentlemen,
and it's as plain as the nose on your face. We were looking
up at him, weren't we, when he was fighting the cobra
and fighting, at the same time, to keep the flying machine
from dropping into the crowd? And didn't we see him
fling out his arm with the snake hanging to his wrist?
The force in the throw of the arm&mdash;and there's some
strength there, gentlemen, believe me," interjected the
doctor, patting the biceps&mdash;"flung the reptile off. It fell,
and so close to me that I had the pleasure of putting my
heel on its head. Do you suppose for a minute that the
cobra could hang to Motor Matt's arm without biting?
I am surprised at you."</p>

<p>"What's the answer?" inquired one of the other two.</p>

<p>"The venom of the cobra," proceeded Doctor Horton,
"acts swiftly on the human system. Yet we see here
none of the symptoms attending such poisoning. By now,
you understand, they should be well advanced. You ask
me the reason our brave young friend is in a normal condition?
A scientific fact has come to his rescue. It is
well known," and the doctor accented the "well" and
gave his medical confrères a humorous glance, "that the
cobra can bite, but cannot release its poison <i>unless the
fangs come together in the wound</i>. In this case, the
fangs did not meet, consequently the bite was as harmless
as that of the ordinary garter snake."</p>

<p>Dr. Horton slipped his fingers along Matt's wrist and
gripped his hand.</p>

<p>"You are to be congratulated; my lad," he went on.
"It was your quickness in seizing the snake, I infer, and
in hurling it from the aëroplane, that prevented it from
laying firm hold of you. Tell us what happened. We
have learned a little from the acrobat who was on the
trapeze, and who dropped off when near the ground, but
we were all too much excited, at the time, to pay much attention
to him. Besides, he was under the aëroplane, and
in no position to know just what went on in your vicinity.
Give us the facts."</p>

<p>Matt, relieved beyond expression, told of the cause of
the short circuit, and of his attempts to get the machine
in the right position for alighting; and finished with a
terse account of the way he had grabbed the cobra and
flung it from him.</p>

<p>The exciting chronicle was set forth in few words and
with the utmost diffidence. The recital, however, struck
an undernote of courage and self-sacrifice in the line of
duty that caught Doctor Horton's admiration.</p>

<p>"Once more," said the physician, taking Matt's hand.
"What you accomplished, my lad, was nobly done. How
many could have kept their wits in such a situation? Not
many&mdash;hardly one out of a thousand. You're the manager
of this show, are you?" he added, turning to Burton.</p>

<p>"I am, yes, sir," replied Boss Burton.</p>

<p>"Then you owe Motor Matt a lot. A fearful accident
has been averted, and you might have been swamped with
damage suits."</p>

<p>The crowd surged around the <i>Comet</i>, and stout canvasmen
had to be summoned to force the people back.
Burton, mounted on his saddle horse, saw a chance to say
a few words.</p>

<p>"Good people," he shouted, "every act down on my
bills is faithfully given exactly as represented. I tolerate
no misstatements in any of my paper. The gallant
young motorist, who has exhibited his aëroplane to you
this afternoon in an act more thrilling than even the most
imaginative showman could advertise, is but one of many
artists of world-wide reputation whom I have secured, at
fabulous expense, to amuse you behind yonder tented
walls. This is the only show now on the road to give,
absolutely free, such a grand outdoor flying machine exhibition.
Other acts, equally thrilling and instructive,
will soon be performed in the two large rings and on the
elevated stage under the main canvas. The doors are
now open."</p>

<p>With that Boss Burton, having secured probably the
greatest advertisement his show had ever received, rode
off in the direction of the tents.</p>

<p>While the crowd followed, and Matt and McGlory
found themselves, for the first time, able to have a little
heart-to-heart talk, they drew off to one side and began
making the most of their opportunity.</p>

<p>"Say, pard," said the cowboy glumly, "I'm about ready
to quit this aëroplane business."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"There's not money enough in the country to pay me
for going through what I did when I saw you swinging
aloft with the cobra."</p>

<p>"You saw it?" queried Matt.</p>

<p>"That's what I did, and I yelled and tried to let you
know about it, but the crowd was making so much noise
you couldn't hear."</p>

<p>Dusk was beginning to fall, and the gasoline torches
about the show grounds leaped out like dazzling fireflies.
McGlory stared at them thoughtfully for a space, then
passed a handkerchief across his damp forehead.</p>

<p>"It don't pay," he muttered. "You take all the risk,
Matt, and Ping and I just slop around and kick you off
when you make your jump skyward. I'd rather, enough
sight, have been up in the machine with you than standing
down here on the ground, watching and worrying."</p>

<p>Matt did not dismiss his cowboy pard's words with the
careless laugh he usually had for such sage remarks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span></p>

<p>"It's all nonsense, of course," said he, "your talking
about me taking all the risk and doing all the work. I fly
the machine because I'm the only one who can do it, but
you help me in other ways that are just as important. I'm
in the air for perhaps thirty minutes each day, while
you're on the ground, old pard, and watching things during
every hour of the twenty-four."</p>

<p>"Watching things!" exploded McGlory. "Speak to
me about that! How well do I watch things? Did I see
the Hindoo when he hitched that bag with the snake to
the aëroplane? It was my business to get onto that, and
I didn't know until you had left the road and were too
far up to hear me. That's what I'm kicking about. I fell
down&mdash;and I'm to blame for the whole bloomin' mishap."</p>

<p>"You're not," said Matt sharply, "and I won't have
you say so. It's useless to harp on such things, anyhow,
Joe, so let's discuss something of more importance."</p>

<p>"The way you fooled the cobra? Why, that's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not that, either. The bag tied to the aëroplane has
the name of the show lettered on it, so&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Burton and I both discovered that," interrupted McGlory.
"Carter had two bags containing the show money.
We already had one, and that bag's the other. Wait,
and I'll get it."</p>

<p>McGlory dived under the lower wing of the machine
and groped about until he found the bag.</p>

<p>"There was nothing in it but the snake," said he, as
he rejoined Matt. "It was a bagful of trouble, all right,
at that. Fine two-tongue performance the Hindoo gave
when he said he had sold the snake. Sufferin' Ananias!
I suspected him of putting the bag there the minute I
saw the cobra crawling up onto the lower wing, behind
you and Le Bon."</p>

<p>"Did you hunt for the fellow?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> we! Why, Burton had every man that could be
spared from the show chasing all over the grounds.
What's more, he sent word to the police, and they're on
the hunt. Here's what that Hindoo tinhorn has done:
He tried to make Rajah wreck the aëroplane, and he tried
his best to get you and the cobra mixed up while in the
air. Why? What's his reason for actin' like that?"</p>

<p>"Give it up, Joe. Not only has Dhondaram done all
that, but he has lifted Burton's ticket-wagon money.
There's something back of it all, and I'd give a farm to
know just what it is. If I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>McGlory was interrupted by a cracked voice, down the
road, lifted in what purported to be song:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Hi le, hi lo, hi le, hi lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bei uns gets immer je länger je schlimmer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hi le, hi lo, hi le, hi lo,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bei uns gets immer ja so!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"Carl!" exclaimed Matt. "I could tell that voice of his
among a thousand."</p>

<p>"But what the nation is he coming with?" cried McGlory,
peering along the road into the gloom. "Looks
like he had a rig of some kind."</p>

<p>The "rig," when it drew closer, proved to be one of the
donkey carts driven by the clowns in the parade. The
Dutch boy was walking ahead and leading the donkey.</p>

<p>"Hooray for der greadt tedectif!" whooped Carl,
bringing the donkey outfit to a halt. "Modor Matt, I haf
dit vat you say."</p>

<p>"What have you done, Carl?" returned Matt curiously.</p>

<p>"Come aroundt by der cart und take a look!"</p>

<p>Thereupon Carl caught Matt's arm and led him to the
cart. The cart was small and mounted on low wheels,
and Matt and McGlory had no difficulty in looking down
into it.</p>

<p>Ping, his hands and feet tied together, was roped to the
seat. Suddenly he set up a wail.</p>

<p>"My velly bad China boy!" he whimpered, "velly bad
China boy. Motol Matt, you no like Ping ally mo'."</p>

<p>"Dot's vat I dit," observed Carl, puffing out his chest,
folding his arms, and striking an attitude. "I ketch der

he don'd vas any goot. Vat I tell you ven ve vas at

<p class="chaptitle">PING ON THE WRONG TRACK.</p>


<p>To say that Motor Matt and Joe McGlory were surprised
at the odd situation confronting them would paint
their feelings in too faint a color.</p>

<p>"How did this happen?" demanded Matt.</p>

<p>"Me," said Carl, "I made it habben. Venefer I go
afder some fellers I ged him. Yah, so!"</p>

<p>"What's Ping tied up for?"</p>

<p>"To make sure mit meinseluf dot he vould come."</p>

<p>"Where did you find him?"</p>

<p>"In vone oof dose ganvas wagons bedween vich der

und vile he shleep, py shiminy, I ged der rope on his

der shink. You say to pring him, und I dit. Dere he
vas. Ven Modor Matt tell Carl Pretzel to do somet'ing,
id vas as goot as dit."</p>

<p>Another wail came from Ping, but it was not accompanied
by any words that could be understood.</p>

<p>"Take the ropes off him, Carl," ordered Matt. "You
should not have tied him like that."</p>

<p>"Den for vy he shleep in der ganvas wagon ven you
tell him to drail der Hintoo?"</p>

<p>"Ping will explain about that."</p>

<p>"My velly bad China boy," gurgled the prisoner. "Motol
Matt no likee ally mo'. Givee China boy bounce."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>Carl, with an air of great importance, proceeded to
take the cords off Ping's hands. The moment the ropes
were all removed Ping leaped at Carl over the side of the
cart, grabbed him savagely, and they both went down
and rolled over and over in the road. The mixture of
pidgin English and Dutch dialect that accompanied the
scrimmage was appalling.</p>

<p>Quickly as they could, Matt and McGlory separated the
boys and held them apart.</p>

<p>"I told you somet'ing," yelled Carl, "und dot iss der
shinks is der vorst peoples vat I know."</p>

<p>"Dutchy boy no good!" piped Ping. "No lettee China
boy savee face. Woosh!"</p>

<p>"Here, now," spoke up Matt sternly. "Tell us all about
this, Ping. Did you follow the Hindoo, as I told you?"</p>

<p>"Allee same," answered the Chinese boy.</p>

<p>"Why did you leave the trail? Did you lose it?"</p>

<p>"My velly bad China boy," insisted Ping, with the
usual wail.</p>

<p>"You didn't lose the trail?"</p>

<p>"No losee, just makee stop."</p>

<p>"You quit following the Hindoo?"</p>

<p>"Allee same," sniffed Ping.</p>

<p>"What was the reason?"</p>

<p>"My velly&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I know all that, but tell me why you quit following
Dhondaram."</p>

<p>"Him makee tlacks fo' ticket wagon, makee pidgin with
tlicket man, makee go to canvas wagon, makee hide.
Bymby, 'long come Dutchy boy, blingee tlicket man.
Tlicket man him cally two bag. Hindoo makee jump,
hittee Dutchy boy, knockee down." Ping chuckled as
though he considered the matter a good joke. "Tlicket
man and Hindoo man takee money bags, empty allee
same in hat, takee snake flom basket, puttee snake in one
bag, puttee othel bag in Dutchy boy's pocket. My savvy.
Hindoo man and tlicket man stealee money, makee think

Stopee follow tlail. Dutchy boy findee heap tlouble. My
no ketchee Motol Matt, for' Motol Matt makee China boy
tellee 'bout Dutchy boy. Woosh! Ping him velly bad
China boy. No likee Dutchy boy. Heap likee him get in
tlouble."</p>

<p>Here was a lot of information tied up in a small and
ragged bundle of pidgin. In order to develop all the
different parts of it, Matt undertook a line of patient
cross-examination.</p>

<p>When the talk was finished the fact that stood out
prominently was this, that Ping had allowed his feeling
against Carl to beguile him into a most reprehensible
course of conduct. He saw the thieves at work, and
guessed that they were trying to involve Carl in the robbery.
Ping was glad to have Carl involved, so he stopped
following the Hindoo and hid himself away in order that
Matt might not find him and learn the truth. It was sad
but true that the China boy had let his hostility to Carl
lure him away on the wrong track.</p>

<p>"Ping," said Matt sternly, "you acted like a heathen.
Carl is a friend of mine, and entitled to your consideration.
Instead of helping him out of his trouble, you held
back in the hope that he would get into deep water. You
can't work for me if you act like that."</p>

<p>"My makee mistake, velly bad mistake," moaned Ping.
"No makee ally mo'."</p>

<p>"You have been telling yarns about Carl, too," went on
Matt. "You told Boss Burton that you had found Carl
going through your clothes and taking&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Py shiminy Grismus!" whooped Carl. "Take your
handts avay, McGlory, und led me ged at dot yellow feller.
Schust vonce, only vonce! He has peen telling
aroundt dot I vas a ropper! <i>Ach, du lieber!</i> I vas so
madt I feel like I bust oop."</p>

<p>"Hold your bronks, Carl," growled McGlory. "You're
not going to get away."</p>

<p>"Allee same, Motol Matt, my speakee like that," acknowledged
Ping. "Dutchy boy say China boy no good.
My no likee."</p>

<p>"You told things that were not true," proceeded Matt,
"and they helped to get Carl into trouble."</p>

<p>"My savvy."</p>

<p>"Are you sorry you did it?"</p>

<p>"Heap solly, you bettee."</p>

<p>"Py shinks," fussed Carl, "I'll make him sorrier as dot,
vone oof dose days."</p>

<p>"I guess, Joe," remarked Matt, "that we'll have to cut
loose from both Carl and Ping. What's the use of trying
to do anything with them? They act like young hoodlums,
and I'm ashamed to own them for pards."</p>

<p>"Pull the pin on the pair of them, Matt," counseled
McGlory. "They make us more trouble than they're
worth."</p>

<p>A howl of protest went up from Carl.</p>

<p>"For vy you cut loose from me, hey?" he demanded.
"I dit vat you say. I pring in der shink."</p>

<p>"You don't do what I say, Carl," answered Matt. "I
have tried to get you two boys to bury the hatchet, but
you won't. This bickering of yours has resulted in a lot
of trouble for all hands, and pretty serious trouble, at
that. We can't work together unless we're all on friendly
terms."</p>

<p>"My makee fliendly terms," said Ping eagerly. "Givee
China boy anothel chance, Motol Matt. Plenty soon my
go top-side, you no givee chance."</p>

<p>"Schust gif me some more shances, too, bard," begged
Carl. "I don'd vant to haf you cut me adrift like vat you
say."</p>

<p>"Well," returned Matt thoughtfully, "I'll give you just
one more opportunity. Take the mule and wagon, both
of you, and return them to the place where Carl found
them. Remember this, though, that you can't travel with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
McGlory and me unless you show a little more friendship
toward each other."</p>

<p>Carl and Ping stepped forward in the gloom. There
was a moment's hesitation, and then Carl took the mule
by the halter and moved off. Ping trailed along behind.</p>

<p>"Don't say a word to any one about what Ping discovered,"
Matt called after the boys, and both shouted back
their assurances that they would not.</p>

<p>"Well, tell me about that!" gasped McGlory, his voice
between a growl and a chuckle. "Ping saw the robbery,
and was keeping quiet about it just to let Carl get into
a hard row of stumps. He's a heathen, and no mistake."</p>

<p>"But the point that interests me a lot," said Matt, "is
the fact that Carter himself is mixed up in the robbery!
He planned it with this rascally Hindoo, who joined the
show this morning and has been doing his villainous work
all day. Carter was trying to get the benefit of the robbery
and, at the same time, shirk the responsibility and
stay with the show."</p>

<p>"How's that for a double deal?" muttered McGlory,
amazed at the audacity of the ticket seller as Matt put the
case in cold words. "But then," he added, "Ping may not
be telling the truth."</p>

<p>"I've lost a good deal of confidence in Ping," returned
Matt, "but I believe he's giving the matter to us straight.
One of the money bags, as Ping says, was put in Carl's
pocket while he was lying dazed and unconscious from
the blow dealt him by Dhondaram; and Ping also says
that the snake was put in the other bag. That has all
been proved to be the case."</p>

<p>"And Carter must have slashed himself on the cheek
just to make it look to Burton as though he'd had a
rough time during the robbery!"</p>

<p>"Exactly."</p>

<p>"All this fails to explain, though, why Dhondaram
tried to destroy the aëroplane, and then fastened the bag
with the snake to the lower wing of the machine."</p>

<p>"We're on the right track to discover all that. Let's
hunt up Burton, and then we can all three of us have a
talk with Andy Carter."</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" agreed McGlory. "You stay here,
pard, and I'll hunt up some one to watch the <i>Comet</i> while
we're gone. After what's happened to-day, I hate to
leave the machine alone for a minute."</p>

<p>McGlory was not long in coming with a man to look
after the aëroplane, and he and Matt left immediately to
find Boss Burton.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">FACING A TRAITOR.</p>


<p>Inquiry developed the fact that Boss Burton was in the
ticket wagon with Carter, checking over the evening's receipts
and making them ready to be carried to the train
and safely stowed until the next town on the show's
schedule was reached.</p>

<p>"We'll catch Carter right in the strong wagon,"
laughed McGlory, as he and Matt hurried to the place.</p>

<p>The door of the wagon was always kept locked. Matt
knocked, and the voice of Burton demanded to know what
was wanted.</p>

<p>"It's Motor Matt," replied the young motorist. "Let
us in for a few minutes, Burton."</p>

<p>"I'll come out and talk with you. There's not much
room in here."</p>

<p>"I'd rather talk in there," said Matt. "It's important.
McGlory is with me."</p>

<p>A bolt was shoved and the door of the wagon pulled
open.</p>

<p>"What's all the hurry?" asked Burton, as the boys
crowded in.</p>

<p>"You'll know in a few moments," answered Matt, closing
the door behind him and forcing the bolt into its
socket.</p>

<p>Carter sat at a small table on which a shaded oil lamp
was burning. He and Burton, it seemed, had finished
their work, and there were two canvas bags, lettered like
those with which Matt was already familiar, near the
lamp. The bags were bulging with silver and bills. Convenient
to Carter's hand lay a six-shooter.</p>

<p>Matt's eye was on the weapon. There was no telling
what Carter would do when he learned why the boys had
paid their call on him and Burton.</p>

<p>"What's up?" asked Burton.</p>

<p>"Something I've got to talk over with you and Carter,"
replied Matt.</p>

<p>Casually he picked up the revolver.</p>

<p>"A S. and W., eh?" he murmured, giving the weapon a
brief examination. Then, still holding the weapon, he
transfixed the ticket man with a steely look.</p>

<p>"Where's the money that was stolen this afternoon,
Carter?" he asked.</p>

<p>Carter started up.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" he flung back, his face flushing
and then becoming deadly pale.</p>

<p>"That's what I'd like to know," blustered Burton.
"You act as though you thought Andy knew where that
money was."</p>

<p>"He does know," said Matt decisively. "The whole
plot has come out. There were two robbers, Dhondaram
and Carter."</p>

<p>"I'll not stand for this!" cried Carter wrathfully.
"Burton," and he leveled a quick gaze at the showman,
"are you going to let this upstart come in here and insult
me?"</p>

<p>There was an odd glimmer in the showman's eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<p>"Be careful, Matt," he cautioned. "You're making
mighty grave charges."</p>

<p>"Are they any graver," asked Matt, "than the charges
you made against Carl?"</p>

<p>"You haven't the same foundation for them that I had&mdash;and
have now, for that matter."</p>

<p>"You're on a wrong tack, Burton," proceeded Matt.
"The theft of that money was the result of a plot between
the Hindoo and Carter here&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And I struck myself in the head and cut my face, eh?"
sneered Carter. "A likely yarn."</p>

<p>"Whether you were knocked down or not is open to
question. But there isn't any doubt about your cutting
your face. You say you fell against one of the wagon
wheels. There's not a particle of evidence to bear out
the story. You wanted to make it appear as though you
were robbed. Dhondaram hid himself in one of the
wagons&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh, he did!" returned Carter ironically. "He knew
your Dutch pard was going to ask me to go there, I suppose.
If that's the case, why wasn't your Dutch pard
in the plot, too?"</p>

<p>That was the one weak place in Matt's theory. According
to Ping, Dhondaram had gone into hiding at the
wagons. Matt supposed that Ping was a little at sea, or
that the Hindoo had not made for the wagons until he
had seen that Carl and Carter were going there.</p>

<p>"Dhondaram knew what was going to happen," continued
Matt, "and he placed himself where he could be
of most aid in carrying out the plot. He knocked Carl
down, and while the lad lay senseless you and Dhondaram
emptied the money bags into your hats. One of the bags
was placed in Carl's pocket, and the Hindoo took the
snake from the basket and placed it in the other bag.
You two wanted the basket for the money, and you
wanted the empty bag in Carl's pocket in order to throw
suspicion on him. We all know how the other bag was
used. Dhondaram said&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Carter gave a startled jump, and a muttered oath fell
from his lips.</p>

<p>"Did that infernal scoundrel tell you all this?" rasped
out the ticket man.</p>

<p>"I'm not saying a word about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I know he did!" ground out Carter, going all to pieces
on the mere suspicion. "He told it all, and you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>With a sharp cry of rage, Carter flung himself at Motor
Matt and made a desperate effort to secure the revolver.
Matt hung to the weapon, and Burton caught Carter and
pushed him down in his chair.</p>

<p>"Here's a fine how-d'ye-do," grunted Burton. "Andy,
you've worked for me two years, and I never thought
you'd turn against me like this!"</p>

<p>"It was Ben Ali roped me into it," was Carter's angry
reply. "If I had that gun in my hands, I'd show you a
trick or two. Well," and he threw a look at Burton, chagrined
but defiant, "what are you going to do about it?"</p>

<p>The showman sat down on the edge of the table.</p>

<p>"You admit the whole business, eh, Andy?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Dhondaram seems to have given his side of the story,
and I might as well give mine," answered the ticket man.</p>

<p>Matt flashed a look at McGlory. The king of the
motor boys had not intended to convey the impression
that the Hindoo had been captured and had confessed,
but Carter, out of his guilty conscience, had jumped to
that conclusion.</p>

<p>"You might as well tell it all, Andy, and be perfectly
frank with me," said Burton. "What had Ben Ali to do
with the affair?"</p>

<p>"He figured it out while he was with the show," went
on Carter. "So&mdash;&mdash;" He broke off suddenly. "But
what good is it going to do me to tell you all this?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"It may do you a lot of good, Andy, and it may not
do you any. You'll have to take your chances on that."</p>

<p>Carter was thoughtful for a few moments, and then
gave vent to a bitter laugh.</p>

<p>"Well," said he recklessly, "here goes, neck or nothing.
I'll see to it, though, that this Dhondaram has his share
of the responsibility," and a glitter crept into the ticket
man's eyes. "As I say, Ben Ali figured out how the game
could be worked. We were going to try it long before we
reached Lafayette, but circumstances didn't just shape
themselves so we could pull it off. I thought about the
deal for some time before I agreed to go into it. The
habit you have, Burton, of making me tote the money
bags to the calliope tent after the ticket office closes for
the afternoon show first gave Ben Ali the idea. But
Ben Ali, as you all know, made things too hot to hold
him, in the show, and had to pull out. I was glad of it,
for I thought the temptation had been taken away from
me entirely, but this morning along comes Dhondaram,
direct from Ben Ali&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"From Ben Ali?" echoed Motor Matt.</p>

<p>"Speak to me about that!" grunted McGlory.</p>

<p>"Surprise to you, eh, Motor Matt?" observed Carter,
with an evil grin. "Ben Ali is a bad man to get down on
you, and I guess he's got as big a grouch against Motor
Matt as he could have against any fellow on earth. Ben
Ali, since he left the show, has been framing up a scheme
to put the king of the motor boys out of business. In order
to carry out his plan, he sent to Chicago for Dhondaram&mdash;and,
between you and me, that's where Ben Ali
made a mistake. The two Hindoos met near the town of
Lafayette somewhere, and Ben Ali told Dhondaram
what he wanted. Dhondaram was to hire out as a keeper
for Rajah, and the elephant was to do the business for the
aëroplane. The cobra was to make things warm for Motor
Matt. It was all cut and dried between the two Hindoos.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
But I was rung into it when Ben Ali told Dhondaram
to work the hold-up here in Jackson. Dhondaram
came to me at the ticket wagon and I had a short talk
with him. He said he'd bowl me over and get the money,
and then take chances on getting away and playing even
with Motor Matt later. I didn't know how the Hindoo
was to work it; and I wouldn't have gone into the game
at all if I had known all that was to happen.</p>

<p>"Dhondaram heard me talking with the Dutchman
when he flagged me and wanted to talk. He must also
have heard the Dutchman mention the canvas wagons,
for he was there when we reached them. The first thing
I knew the Dutchman was down, lying like a log on the
ground. There was nothing for me to do then but to mar
myself up and make it look as though there had been a
fracas. We put the money in the basket, and hid the
basket under a pile of old canvas in one of the wagons.
It was arranged that I should meet Dhondaram to-night,
bring the basket, and then we'd divide the loot.</p>

<p>"But I was suspicious of Dhondaram. He was a
stranger to me, and I wasn't going to trust him. During
the afternoon, while the aëroplane flight was on, I took
the basket out of the wagon and stowed it in another
place. By doing that I made it impossible for the Hindoo
to pick it up and slope without meeting me. That's all."</p>

<p>"Where's the money?" inquired Burton.</p>

<p>He had had abundant faith in Andy Carter, and there
was something almost sad in the showman's face as he
listened to the tale of treachery.</p>

<p>Carter leaned forward.</p>

<p>"I'll tell you that, Burton," he answered, "just as soon
as you promise to let me off and not make any move
against me on account of the robbery."</p>

<p>The brazenness of the proposition struck Burton, and
struck him hard. But it was the logical thing for Carter
to do, in the circumstances. It was a trump card, and he
was cunning enough to know how to play it.</p>

<p>"I'm getting a good many surprises to-night," muttered
Burton, "but I guess I deserve it for trusting a
whelp like you. I agree, of course. You know very
well I can't do anything else."</p>

<p>"You'll not take any legal action against me?" asked
Carter eagerly.</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Of course I can't work for the show any longer?"</p>

<p>"Well, I should say not! What do you take me for?"</p>

<p>"I thought as much, but I wanted to make sure."</p>

<p>"Just a moment," put in Matt. "Where were you to
meet Dhondaram, and at what time?"</p>

<p>"Didn't he tell you that? It was to be sometime before
the show was over, at the edge of the grounds on
the south side. I was to come that way with the basket,
and whistle. Where did you nab the Hindoo? I suppose
it was that infernal snake business that got you
after him."</p>

<p>"He hasn't been nabbed," returned Matt. "You took
that for granted, Carter."</p>

<p>Carter sank back in his chair and stared. Then he
swore under his breath.</p>

<p>"I'm a fool of the first water, and no mistake," said
he, "but that Hindoo will kill me if he's left at large.
You can capture him if you go where I told you and do
what I said. I'm playing in tough luck, Burton," he
added dejectedly.</p>

<p>"You're playing in more luck than you ought to have,
at that," snarled Burton. "Put on your hat and coat,
and we'll go for the money."</p>

<p>"No," put in Matt, "let me take his hat and coat."</p>

<p>Burton stared, then gave a short laugh as Matt's plan
drifted over him.</p>

<p>"Right you are, Matt," said he. "Put on the hat and
coat. I guess Carter won't take any harm going out
in his shirt sleeves and without his hat. But give me
the gun. That will be of use in case Andy forgets his
agreement."</p>

<p>A few minutes later they all left the ticket wagon,
locking the door behind them. The wagon was constructed
of boiler iron, and the money in the bags would
be safe where it was until the time came for loading the
show and getting ready to move to the next town.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">MEETING THE HINDOO.</p>


<p>Andy Carter, as it turned out, was playing his part in
good faith. Perhaps he reasoned that he had been sufficiently
treacherous, and that the very least he could do
was to wind up a bad business on the square.</p>

<p>The basket, removed by him from the canvas wagon
to prevent the Hindoo from making off with it, had been
carried to a clump of bushes not far from the railroad
tracks, on the north side of the show grounds, and covered
with a pile of broken sticks and other refuse.</p>

<p>Men were already pulling down some of the auxiliary
tents and loading them into wagons and driving the
wagons to the waiting train. The elephants and nearly
all the animal cages had been loaded, while the band
wagons and the "chariots" had been stowed in their cars
late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"I suppose you're through with me, now?" inquired
Carter, after Burton had secured the basket.</p>

<p>"I will be," said Burton, "as soon as I make sure that
all the money is here."</p>

<p>"You'll be too late to catch the Hindoo," demurred
Carter, "if you insist on going back to the wagon and
counting over all that stuff."</p>

<p>"Then we'll lay the Hindoo by the heels before we
count it. You can go with us, Carter. It'll do you good
to see the fellow caught."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll kill me!" declared Carter, drawing back.</p>

<p>"I guess he won't. There are too many of us for him
to cut up very rough."</p>

<p>"If he sees all of us coming across the grounds, he'll
suspect something and sheer off."</p>

<p>"There's sense in that, all right," remarked Burton.
"On the whole, I believe I'll change my plans."</p>

<p>Burton stopped one of the wagons that was moving
toward the train.</p>

<p>"Where's Harris?" he asked of the driver of the
wagon.</p>

<p>"He's comin' right behind me," was the answer.</p>

<p>Harris was Burton's brother-in-law, and had always
been in the showman's confidence. He was riding on a
pile of tent poles, holding a couple of trunks on the load.</p>

<p>"Harris," called Burton, "I want you to take this basket
down to the train for me. Don't let it get out of your
hands."</p>

<p>"Another snake in it, Burton?" queried Harris, as he
reached down for the basket.</p>

<p>"Well," answered Burton, "I wouldn't look into it to
find out. Mind what I say and don't let the basket get
away from you."</p>

<p>Having been reassured on this point by Harris, Burton,
Matt, McGlory, and Carter moved on. Picking up
two men at the dismantled animal tent, Burton turned
Carter over to them.</p>

<p>"Andy has resigned," the showman explained dryly
to the men, "and he wants to go to the train after his
trunk. You men go with him, and keep hold of him all
the time. Understand? See that he don't take anything
but what belongs to him."</p>

<p>Carter was none too well liked among the show people,
and the two men agreed cheerfully to look after him.</p>

<p>"Now," said Burton, as he walked off with Matt and
McGlory, "we're in shape to meet the Hindoo. I don't
know what I can do with the scoundrel after I get my
hands on him. If he is put in jail here, I'll have to come
back myself, or send somebody else, to make out a case
against him. That wouldn't do&mdash;it would only cause
extra expense and a loss of time. I guess we'll tie him
up and take him along with us on section two of the
train."</p>

<p>"Dhondaram ought to be made pay for what he has
done," said Matt. "I think you ought to go to a little
inconvenience, Burton, in the interests of law and order."</p>

<p>"The inconveniences may be more than you think,
Matt. Suppose you would have to come back here to
testify against the Hindoo? That would mean no aëroplane
work for two or three days. I couldn't stand for
that."</p>

<p>By that time, the three were close to the south side of
the grounds. There were scattered clumps of bushes,
here, and a few trees.</p>

<p>"We'd better hang back, Matt," whispered Burton,
"while you go on and do the whistling. We'll be near
enough to help you when Dhondaram shows himself. If
he's too ugly, I'll use the revolver."</p>

<p>"He's got a bowie, Matt," cautioned McGlory. "Don't
let him get a hack at you with it. He could help out
Ben Ali's scheme of vengeance a good deal handier with
the knife than with the cobra."</p>

<p>Matt stepped on ahead of Burton and McGlory, and
began to whistle softly. He had not gone twenty feet
before the whistle was answered and a dark figure
stepped shadowily from behind some bushes.</p>

<p>"Carter Sahib!" came a low call.</p>

<p>"Dhondaram?" returned Matt.</p>

<p>"Here!" came the eager answer. "Have you brought
the basket, sahib?"</p>

<p>"You know why I was to meet you," replied Matt,
ignoring the question.</p>

<p>He disguised his voice as well as he could, and the low
tone in which he spoke served still further to hide his
identity.</p>

<p>The Hindoo could see that Matt was not carrying anything,
and evidently his distrust was aroused.</p>

<p>"The sahib is fooling me!" he exclaimed. "You have
not brought with you the basket. Part of the money is
mine."</p>

<p>Matt had supposed that the Hindoo would run, as soon
as he detected the trick. But he did not. On the contrary,
he bounded straight at Matt and caught him by
the shoulders.</p>

<p>"I want you, Dhondaram!" cried Matt, dropping his
attempts at concealment. "You're a prisoner!"</p>

<p>Matt was strong, but the Hindoo was as slippery as an
eel. With his arms about him, Matt tried to hold the
villain, and in a measure succeeded. Dhondaram,
however, heard the running feet and the voices
of Burton and McGlory and redoubled his desperate
efforts to escape.</p>

<p>He broke from Matt's arms, but Matt caught his left
wrist and clung to it like a leech. With his right hand
the Hindoo jerked his knife from his sash and made a
vicious lunge with it.</p>

<p>Matt avoided the lunge, and before the attack could be
repeated the showman and the cowboy had reached the
scene.</p>

<p>Then, even with all three of them against him, Dhondaram
made a desperate resistance. But numbers prevailed,
and the rascally scoundrel's hands were bound
at his back by means of his turban, which was opened
out and twisted into a makeshift rope.</p>

<p>"He's a fighter, and no mistake," panted Burton, as he
held the prisoner by one arm while McGlory took the
other. "No more nonsense, Dhondaram," the showman
threatened, flashing the weapon in front of his eyes.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
"You see what I've got? Well, look out that I don't
use it."</p>

<p>The six-shooter, dimly visible in the gloom, had a
quieting effect on the Hindoo.</p>

<p>"Don't shoot, sahib," he begged. "I go where you
want."</p>

<p>"That's better," said Burton. "Trot along, and we'll
soon be where we're going."</p>

<p>Their destination was the train, and they presently
had Dhondaram in the sleeping car attached to section
two. Very few of the show people had arrived, as yet,
and an attempt was made to get a little information out
of the prisoner.</p>

<p>But the Hindoo would not talk. In response to every
question put to him, he shook his head and held his
tongue.</p>

<p>"He'll talk with us in the morning," said Burton confidently.
"Just tie his feet, boys, and leave him here. I've
got to go back to the ticket wagon."</p>

<p>Matt and McGlory made the prisoner's feet secure,
and a tap on the window called Matt's attention. Thinking
it might be Burton, wishing to give him a private
message, Matt left the car.</p>

<p>It was not Burton, but Carter and the two men set
to watch him. Carter wanted his hat and coat.</p>

<p>While Matt was returning the borrowed garments,
Carl and Ping came along, talking amiably with each
other. Matt sent them into the car to look after the
Hindoo, and also to tell McGlory to come out and help
prepare the aëroplane for loading.</p>

<p>"I don't know, pard," said McGlory, as he and Matt
made their way hastily to the place where the <i>Comet</i>
had been left, "but I reckon the motor boys have got a
little the best of this ruction that Dhondaram kicked up.
Burton has recovered the stolen money, Carter has been
fired, and Dhondaram is a prisoner. Luck's on our side
after all, eh?"</p>

<p>"That's the way it looks," answered Matt.</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</a></h2>

<p class="chaptitle">A BIT OF A BACKSET.</p>


<p>The preparing of the aëroplane for loading was not a
difficult matter. The small front planes were removed,
and lashed between the two larger planes. This narrowed
the machine sufficiently so that it could be loaded
into the car especially prepared for it.</p>

<p>After the machine had been safely stowed, the two
tired lads went to their section in the sleeper. Burton
was there, sitting under a lamp and hastily running over
the contents of the basket.</p>

<p>"I guess it's all here," said he, dumping the silver and
bills into the receptacle and closing the lid. "Anyhow,
I'm too much fagged to bother any more with the stuff
to-night. It's about time we all turned in, don't you
think?"</p>

<p>"I'm Ready's whole family, when it comes to that,"
yawned McGlory. "Talk about your strenuous days!
I think this has been a harder one than that other day
we put in at Lafayette, Indiana. What do you say,
Matt?"</p>

<p>"We seem to have worked harder than we did then,
and to have less to show for it," said Matt.</p>

<p>"Less to show for it!" repeated Burton. "I don't
know what you mean by that, son. It isn't every day
you save your flying machine from a mad elephant and
wrestle with a cobra on the <i>Comet</i>, in midair!"</p>

<p>"And it's not every day the Big Consolidated is held
up, thieves captured, and <i>dinero</i> recovered, all before
we leave town," supplemented McGlory.</p>

<p>"It was exciting enough," said Matt, "but it all seems
so useless."</p>

<p>"The hand of Ben Ali was behind it all," remarked
Burton, pulling off his shoes. "That villain ought to be
run down and put behind the bars for ninety-nine years.
You'll not be safe a minute, Matt, until he's locked up."</p>

<p>"I guess," ventured the king of the motor boys, "that
Ben Ali, after this lesson, will keep away from me."</p>

<p>"I wish I could think so," said Burton.</p>

<p>"What'll you do with Dhondaram?" inquired McGlory.
"You can't send him to jail in any other town for an
offense he committed in Jackson."</p>

<p>"Sending him to jail is the last thing I'm thinking of,"
was Burton's response. "What I want is to induce him
to talk. He may give us a line on Ben Ali that will
enable Matt to keep away from the wily old villain."</p>

<p>"Don't hang onto Dhondaram on my account," said
Matt. "I've told Ben Ali what to expect if he ever comes
near me again."</p>

<p>"That's you!" exulted McGlory. "All your scare-talk,
Burton, goes clean over Matt's head."</p>

<p>The showman pulled off his coat and leaned back in
his seat reflectively. He did not seem to have heard
McGlory's observation.</p>

<p>"I've got a notion," began Burton, "that&mdash;&mdash;" He
paused.</p>

<p>"What's the notion?" urged the cowboy. "It ain't like
you to hang fire, Burton."</p>

<p>"Well," pursued Burton, "it's this way: I've got an
elephant on my hands that can't be handled by any white
trainer in the show. Dhondaram can handle the brute to
the queen's taste. What's the answer?"</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," expostulated Matt, "that
you're going to keep Dhondaram with the show just to
take charge of Rajah?"</p>

<p>"It's either that or sell the elephant," declared Burton.</p>

<p>"Then, sufferin' cats!" cried McGlory, "sell the brute.
You're more kinds of a bungler, Burton, than I know
how to lay tongue to. Keep Dhondaram with the show,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
and he'll do something, before you're through with him,
that will hurt."</p>

<p>"I'll sleep on it," muttered Burton. "I've only got
four elephants, and I need Rajah."</p>

<p>"Schust a minid, oof you blease," came the voice of
Matt's Dutch pard from the aisle of the car.</p>

<p>Matt, McGlory, and Burton turned around and saw
not only Carl, but Ping as well.</p>

<p>"What is it, Carl?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>"I vant to know somet'ing," Carl went on, "und dot iss,
was I innocend or guildy? Vat you say, Misder Purton?"</p>

<p>"Oh, splash!" exclaimed Burton, "that was settled a
long time ago. Andy Carter, the ticket man, admitted
that he and the Hindoo were the thieves."</p>

<p>"Den Modor Matt don'd haf to vork four veeks for
nodding, schust for me?"</p>

<p>"Of course not."</p>

<p>"Dot's all I vanted to know, oxcept somet'ing else."</p>

<p>"Well, what?"</p>

<p>"Der Hintoo brisoner iss in der blace vere Ping
shleeps. Ping vants to go to ped, und I am to haf der
ubber bert'. Vat iss to be dit mit der Hintoo?"</p>

<p>"Roll him into the aisle and let him lie there," replied
Burton. "Put a blanket under him, if you want to, and
give him a pillow."</p>

<p>"T'anks," said Carl, and the boys started away.</p>

<p>"Wait, Carl," called Matt. "There's a little something
I want to know. How are you and Ping getting along
together?"</p>

<p>"Finer as silk," grinned Carl. "He likes me pedder
der more vat he knows me, und it's der same mit me.
Shinks iss hardt to ondershtand, but I'm schust gedding
ondo Ping's curves. He made a misdake in me, und now
he feels pedder aboudt it. How iss dot, bard?" finished
Carl, turning to the Chinaman.</p>

<p>"Awri'," answered Ping, although not very enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"That's the talk!" cried Matt heartily.</p>

<p>Two hours later, the second section of the show train
was loaded and speeding on its way. All was quiet in
the sleeping car, save for the snores of the tired men who
occupied the bunks.</p>

<p>Perhaps it was two o'clock in the morning when an
uproar filled the sleeper. There were yells, a revolver
shot, the slamming of a door, and then a measure of
quiet.</p>

<p>Matt thrust his head out of his berth and saw McGlory,
equally curious and excited, looking out from the
berth overhead. All up and down each side of the car
were other heads.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Matt.</p>

<p>Boss Burton, in his underclothes, was standing in the
aisle, a smoking revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>"Confound the luck!" he sputtered. "The Hindoo has
made a getaway. I happened to wake up and to think
about him, and took a look along the aisle from my
berth, just to make sure he was safe. I thought I was
dreaming, or had the blind staggers, or something, when
I saw him sitting up. His hands were free and he was
taking the rope off his feet. I grabbed my revolver from
under my pillow and rolled into the aisle. Dhondaram
had started for the door. I blazed away, did nothing but
smash a window, and the Hindoo jumped from the
train."</p>

<p>"Are you going to stop and put back after him?" inquired
Archie Le Bon.</p>

<p>"I guess I won't, although losing the fellow is a bit of
a backset," observed Burton regretfully.</p>

<p>"The show can stand all the backsets of that kind that
come its way, Burton," said Harris.</p>

<p>"What will we do for somebody to manage Rajah?"</p>

<p>"Oh, hang Rajah!" said another of the Le Bon
brothers. "I hope the first section runs into the ditch and
smashes the brute. He came within one of killin' Archie,
back there in Jackson."</p>

<p>It was the general opinion, as the occupants of the
various berths drew sleepily back into their beds, that
it was a good thing Dhondaram escaped.</p>

<p>"Wonder just how much that bit of a backset means
for us, pard?" McGlory inquired of the king of the
motor boys before dropping back on his pillow.</p>

<p>"Nothing, I hope," was the response.</p>

<p>"We'll know for sure, I reckon, before we're many
days older," muttered the cowboy as he straightened out
in his bed and returned to his dreams of cobras and
charging elephants.</p>

<p>"And so your sister's going to spend the winter at Nassau,
for her health, eh? Well, she might do worse, for it's very
pleasant there, with its lovely climate, and pineapples, shells,
sponges, and curiosities. Yes, I've been to the Bahama Islands.
Didn't start for there, and didn't make any entry
at the custom house, but I got there, all the same. It was a
lively adventure, and no mistake."</p>

<p>It was Captain Joe who made this speech, one day, as we
sat on a wooden pier, angling for fish, which, I may add,
we didn't catch.</p>

<p>The captain, now that his active sea days were over, lived
with his brother near-by, and was never so happy as when
fishing with us boys, or spinning yarns to while away the
time whenever the inconsiderate fish refused to bite.</p>

<p>"I reckon I may as well tell you about it," he went on,
"since that steamboat has stirred up the mud till no fish can
see the bait.</p>

<p>"I was eighteen years old then, and the doctors gave me
just twelve months to live, for I was very delicate, and so,
when we started, one raw November day, from Boston, for
a voyage to Rio and back, I was as blue as an indigo bag.</p>

<p>"The wind was fierce and cold, and the sea was lumpy,
and we tumbled and rolled about like the mischief for five
or six days, when we struck finer weather, and I at once
began to feel better.</p>

<p>"But a few days later the weather grew bad rapidly, so
that by midnight it was blowing half a gale, with a tremendous
sea on that made the good brig <i>Polly Ann</i> tumble about
as lively as a Scotchman dancing the Highland fling.</p>

<p>"It was a fearful storm, indeed, almost a regular hurricane,
and lasted for two days before it gave any signs of
blowing itself out.</p>

<p>"And then, when at last it began to subside, we found that
we had sustained considerable damage, both our topmasts
being gone, the mainmast sprung, and the rudder so twisted
as to be of little service.</p>

<p>"We had taken no observation for sixty hours, and were
rather uncertain as to our location, which did not add to our
comfort by any means.</p>

<p>"It was well past midnight, and I had dropped off into a
doze, when I was awakened by a tremendous shock that made
everything tremble.</p>

<p>"As I sat upright in my berth, there was a second shock,
lighter than the first, and then the brig began to pound and
thump, with a grinding, crushing sound.</p>

<p>"In another moment the mate came running down into the
cabin after something, with a scared look on his face, and
cried out:</p>

<p>"'We're on the reefs, and the brig's going to pieces!' and
then he rushed on deck again.</p>

<p>"I got up and tried to climb the ladder, but a dash of water
came through the open hatch and washed me back.</p>

<p>"Somebody jammed the hatch shut, and I was a prisoner
below.</p>

<p>"The next moment a big wave lifted the brig up and sent
her higher up on the reefs, and she rested quietly with no
more pounding or thumping.</p>

<p>"The captain came down after a while, and said we were
ashore on the Bahama reefs, and as the ship was easy now,
and there was no immediate danger, we could do nothing but
wait for daylight.</p>

<p>"As dawn broke, I was on deck with the rest, the excitement
of the occasion, or something else, having put new life
into me, and I cared nothing for the sheets of spray and
foam that, flying over the rails, drenched us all to the skin
every minute.</p>

<p>"Before us, half a mile distant, was a low, white coast,
covered with sand hills, and a few cocoa palms, their long,
slender leaves thrashing about in the wind like a lot of enormous
feather dusters.</p>

<p>"The sea about us was churned into a mass of foam as
the incoming waves were broken in pieces on the coral reefs,
whose sharp, jagged tops of honeycomb rock rose here and
there above the surface like the brown teeth of some marine
monster.</p>

<p>"Between the coral reefs and the shore there was a stretch
of smoother water, in marked contrast with the tumbling
sea outside.</p>

<p>"It was a perfect caldron of foaming water close about
us, in which no boat could live a second, and so we waited
as patiently as we could for the going down of the adjacent
sea.</p>

<p>"Half an hour thereafter, to our great relief, we beheld a
stanch little schooner rounding a point well inside the reefs,
and making for us; and as she drew nearer we saw that her
decks were full of men, white and black, clad in such a
variety of costumes, with such diversity of loud colors, as at
once suggested a piratical band of the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>"But appearances were deceptive, for instead of freebooters
bent on plunder, the strangers were good Samaritans coming
to our rescue&mdash;a lot of Bahamian wreckers&mdash;men ever ready
to save life and property for a consideration.</p>

<p>"The captain of the little craft, which rejoiced in the highly
appropriate name of the <i>Fearless</i>, a sturdy, square-built man
of fifty, with light hair and bluish eyes, and a salty air about
him, balancing himself with the skill of an acrobat on the
port rail, and making a trumpet of his hands, began a shouting
conversation with us, in which he informed us that he
wouldn't give a penny for our lives if we weren't ashore
mighty soon, as the wind, backing to the northwest, would
blow great guns again in a few hours, when our brig would
probably go to pieces.</p>

<p>"As the result of this confab, the wreckers began to make
preparations to get us off the brig, which they accomplished
in a skillful and courageous manner, running a line from the
<i>Fearless</i> to our vessel, over which we were hauled in turn,
though we were sorely battered and drenched by the angry
sea that leaped up furiously, as if loath to lose its prey.</p>

<p>"It was well they worked so rapidly, for we were scarcely
ashore, and the schooner anchored behind a point, when the
storm began to rage again with great fury, burying the old
brig in mountains of foaming water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></p>

<p>"When at last the storm abated, it was found that the brig
had broken in two, the stern part sinking in deep water, and
the cargo being scattered for miles along the coast, some of it
being picked up, but in a useless condition, so that the wreckers
realized substantially nothing in the way of salvage.</p>

<p>"In a few days our company went in the <i>Fearless</i> to Green
Turtle Cay village, where they eventually secured a passage
home.</p>

<p>"As for myself, I refused to accompany them, having discovered
a decided improvement in my health, which I naturally
attributed to the climate, which was perfection itself,
with a clear, bright sky, soft, genial breezes, and a pure, dry
atmosphere that seemed to put new life into me with every
breath.</p>

<p>"So I remained to complete the cure so auspiciously begun,
lodging with a planter named Bethel, whom, to pay my
board, I helped with the lighter work in his pineapple fields
by day, giving his children a bit of schooling by night, to the
mutual satisfaction, I am certain, of all concerned.</p>

<p>"The half of the hulk of the <i>Polly Ann</i> still clung to the
great reefs where she had struck, at low tide being nearly
out of water; and every day I looked at it, for it was in
plain view from our veranda, with feelings of mingled pity
and friendship&mdash;for it somehow always suggested to my mind
my far-away home and the dear ones there.</p>

<p>"Ever since the wreck, the weather had been perfect&mdash;such
charming days and nights as can be found only in the
Bahamas following each other uninterruptedly, until, as
Christmas approached, I conceived the idea that it would be
nice to have our holiday luncheon on the deck of the hulk,
and in this scheme all acquiesced, thinking it would be novel
and delightful.</p>

<p>"But the twenty-third of December ushered in a gale that
swept with fury along the coast.</p>

<p>"For twenty-four hours the elements held high carnival,
and then, on Christmas Eve, there came a great lull, and the
fierce storm, veering to the southward, died away as suddenly
as it had arisen, giving us hope that our original plan
might yet be carried out.</p>

<p>"We were up early on Christmas morning, and looking
seaward, were astonished beyond measure at what we saw.</p>

<p>"The hulk of the <i>Polly Ann</i> had been loosened from the
clutch of the coral reef and carried bodily over the ledge by
the great waves&mdash;had been hurled upon the low inside beach,
a huge broken mass, with its stern buried deep in the wet
sand, its heavy timbers splintered to pieces, and its rusty iron
bolts twisted like corkscrews.</p>

<p>"We rushed to the beach&mdash;now as hard and smooth as a
floor&mdash;and saw, scattered about near the nose of the <i>Polly
Ann</i>, some circular pieces, which we at first took to be
brownish-colored shells, but which we soon discovered were
nothing of the kind.</p>

<p>"I picked up a piece and found it to be nearly two inches
broad, perfectly flat and smooth, the edge worn almost sharp,
with some inscription on one side and figures on the other,
which we could scarcely trace, so black and discolored was
the entire surface.</p>

<p>"I ran to a bit of honeycomb rock and rubbed the piece
briskly over it, until presently the tarnish began to come off,
and I shouted to Bethel that it was a piece of silver.</p>

<p>"'My stars!' he cried out, in great excitement, 'if it's not
an old Spanish dollar.'</p>

<p>"And then he danced about like mad for a minute.</p>

<p>"Next we fell to work picking up all we could find till both
our hats were nearly full of the pieces.</p>

<p>"'Where in the world did they come from?' asked Bethel,
after we had gathered in the last coin. 'I didn't suppose your
old brig carried such a cargo, did you?'</p>

<p>"'I never thought so, surely,' said I; 'nor do I believe
she did.'</p>

<p>"'Where else could these coins have come from?' asked
Bethel.</p>

<p>"'I don't know,' said I. 'But as the <i>Polly Ann</i> is only ten
years old, and these coins are near two hundred, if they are a
day, why, it doesn't stand to reason they were in the brig.
However, we will soon see. If they came out of her, there's
more inside. Come, we will look.'</p>

<p>"We crept inside the old hull and examined carefully
among her shattered timbers and twisted bolts, and spent two
hours in prying up the planks inside the bow and along the
bottom, but at last, tired and breathless, gave it up as a bad
job, and came out as empty-handed as we went in.</p>

<p>"'I told you so,' said I. 'They never sailed the sea in the
<i>Polly Ann</i>.'</p>

<p>"We spent the afternoon in counting our coins, finding we
had between three and four hundred of them, and we grew
quite hilarious over our Christmas gift, as we styled it, and
speculated in vain as to where the coins could have come
from.</p>

<p>"The next morning Bethel said to me:</p>

<p>"'I've been thinking half the night about those coins, and
I remember my father used to tell of a Spanish vessel that
went ashore somewhere along here when he was a boy, and
was gradually washed to pieces; and, do you know, I've an
idea these pieces have been cast up by the sea from the old
wreck. It's curious, however, that we never found any of
them till this brig came plowing up the beach with her nose.'</p>

<p>"While we were talking, two of the children came in with
several of the pieces, which they had found at the water's
edge, exactly like those we had picked up the day before.</p>

<p>"'I tell you, sir,' cried Bethel excitedly, 'my guess was
right. I believe that old Spaniard lies buried in the sand
right where the <i>Polly Ann</i> has stuck her bow in the beach.
Man alive, there may be millions down there!'</p>

<p>"We rushed to the beach, and with shovels began to dig
up the sand vigorously all about the wreck.</p>

<p>"Every now and then we came across another coin, which
encouraged us tremendously, and we worked until we had
dug a hole big enough to hold an ox cart.</p>

<p>"But no more coins appeared, and we were getting discouraged,
when Bethel struck a heavy timber that ran under
the forefoot of the brig, and which did not belong to the
<i>Polly Ann</i>.</p>

<p>"We cleared away the sand alongside this timber, and
there lay a box, made of teak wood, split open from end to
end, and jammed hard and fast between the decaying timber
and the forefoot of the brig.</p>

<p>"The splinters from the box were fresh and clean, showing
that it had been crushed to pieces by the stem of the brig
when she was driven into the beach by the storm.</p>

<p>"And then we dug out the sand from under the debris of
the teak box, and down came a shower of black silver pieces,
exactly similar to the others, which we carefully and eagerly
secured and piled up on the dry beach near by.</p>

<p>"There was no longer any mystery as to where the coins
came from, for we found the rotten timbers of the old Spanish
ship underlying the sand in every direction, none being
less than ten feet from the surface.</p>

<p>"For days we pursued our hunt for treasure, tunneling
all about, but except those in the teak box not another piece
did we find, and at last we desisted, satisfied that we had exhausted
the deposit.</p>

<p>"We kept the thing a secret, lest the authorities, taking
advantage of some old and unjust law, might claim a portion
of our treasure trove; and as there were no near neighbors,
and as a brisk gale, which blew later on, filled up our excavations
in the sand, this was an easy thing to do.</p>

<p>"We divided our find, and my portion was nearly five
thousand dollars, which I brought with me to the United
States late in the ensuing summer, and disposed of it to a
broker in Boston, who was very curious to learn where I
got it.</p>

<p>"But he will never know, unless he learns it from this
story.</p>

<p>"My Christmas gift was most acceptable, as you can readily
believe; out what I valued far more was the fact that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
eight months' residence in the lovely climate of the Bahamas
made me a well man, and my lungs ever since have been as
stout as a blacksmith's bellows.</p>

<p>"It's all right, my boy. Tell your sister she'll have a nice
time at Nassau, and if she doesn't come back in the spring as
good as new, then Captain Joe'll never prophesy again as
long as he lives.</p>

<p>"She'll not find any Spanish dollars, maybe, but there's
things worth more&mdash;and one is good health."</p>

<h2><a name="THE_STORY_OF_A_WILD_GOOSE" id="THE_STORY_OF_A_WILD_GOOSE">THE STORY OF A WILD GOOSE.</a></h2>


<p>Two years ago, one evening, while I was returning home
from an unsuccessful shooting excursion along the Atlantic
shore, I observed a flock of wild geese coming toward me,
but sailing high. I stood perfectly still, and when the flock
was directly overhead I aimed and fired.</p>

<p>In the twilight I could see the flock scattering at the report,
and a bird wheeling downward with one wing limp and
useless. He landed on a patch of plowed ground with a thud
and lay half stunned. In a moment I had secured my prize.</p>

<p>It was a large gander in prime condition, with a full,
deep body, and healthy, lustrous feathers, and I determined
to spare his life.</p>

<p>I quickly tied his legs and fastened the uninjured wing.
Then, carefully lifting the bird and getting the broken limb
into as comfortable a position as possible, I carried him
home. Most sportsmen have a crude knowledge of surgery,
and I soon had the broken member bandaged with splints and
strips of cotton and my captive resting comfortably, unbound,
in a warm outhouse.</p>

<p>In the morning, when I went out to feed him, he was
walking around lively enough, and, although, of course, very
shy and timid, he ate a hearty breakfast of corn as soon as
he thought himself unobserved. In a few days he grew
tame enough to allow me to stroke him with a bit of stick.
It was long before he would suffer himself to be touched by
the human hand.</p>

<p>After some months the bird would answer to his name,
Michael, would eat out of my hand, and when I let him out
into the yard, after clipping his wings, would follow me
around like a dog. He invariably fled at the approach of a
stranger, but he never "hissed" like a domestic goose.
Strange to say, although a flock of domestic geese was kept
by a neighbor, he never paid the slightest attention to their
cries and calls.</p>

<p>After a time I allowed him to roam the fields at will. At
night he returned without fail to his pen. I became much
attached to the bird, so much so that goose shooting became
distasteful to me and I discontinued the practice.</p>

<p>Last spring I received a letter from a particular friend
requesting me to secure a wild goose for him. For various
reasons I could not well refuse, so I at once made arrangements
for a shooting excursion. In the midst of my preparations
it occurred to me that I might employ Michael as a
decoy to lure the geese within gunshot. Sometimes a domestic
goose is used for this purpose, but seldom with complete
success. The wild goose is an intelligent bird, and
rarely places implicit confidence in his domesticated relative.</p>

<p>In a secluded bight some miles down the coast I moored a
small raft near shore and tethered Michael to it by a stout
string fastened to his leg. His wings by this time had grown
to the length they possessed before being clipped, and the
injured limb was as strong as ever.</p>

<p>Michael seemed well pleased with his situation, stretched
his wings a few times as if the salt breath of the ocean
stirred half-buried memories, but on finding himself secured
settled down comfortably on the raft and calmly preened his
gray feathers.</p>

<p>I carefully screened myself behind a clump of scrub spruce
and placed some spare cartridges conveniently near. I
thought that if a passing flock should approach fairly near I
might be able to fire a successful second shot if the first
proved a miss.</p>

<p>After a wait of perhaps an hour I heard in the distance a
faint "honk" that quickened the heartbeats. Michael also
heard it, and ceasing to arrange his feathers, raised his head
to listen eagerly. I watched him closely. His neck was
proudly arched and his eyes glistened with excitement as he
stepped as near the edge of the raft as his tether would
allow.</p>

<p>Presently another "honk" dropped from the distant blue,
and away to the south I could descry a large V-shaped flock
flying fairly low, but altogether too much to the left of my
position to render possible a successful shot.</p>

<p>It was now time for Michael to make himself heard, and
I was beginning to grow somewhat uneasy at his silence,
when all at once&mdash;"honk! honk!"&mdash;his joyous invitation sped
up to the ears of the watchful leader of the air travelers.</p>

<p>"Honk?" queried that wary veteran suspiciously, but at
once he slackened his pace somewhat.</p>

<p>"Honk! honk!" called Michael reassuringly; "honk!
honk!" he repeated coaxingly.</p>

<p>For a moment the old leader seemed to hesitate, then
slowly he turned in my direction, and presently the flock was
sailing directly toward me.</p>

<p>My rifle was ready and in position. I was well screened by
the bushes. The light was admirable. Everything was favorable
to a good shot. In five minutes the flock was within
range. Michael had uttered several invitations during this
time in reply to short interrogations from the leader, but he
had suddenly relapsed into silence. He could see the approaching
birds and was gazing at them with intense eagerness.
My finger was on the trigger, when all at once, to
my amazement, Michael pealed out a strange cry, loud and
shrill, utterly unlike any sound that I had ever heard him
utter.</p>

<p>It was the note of danger, the alarm signal of the wild
goose. The effect on the approaching flock was electrical.
The leader instantly turned and sped away with arrow-like
swiftness, closely followed by his feathered retinue, leaving
me motionless with surprise.</p>

<p>When my captive first heard the calls of his comrades he
instinctively answered with notes of invitation. The excitement
of hearing and seeing his own kindred made him forget
the danger that he was leading them into, but as they approached
he seemed all at once to realize the situation. He
knew that red death lurked behind the seemingly innocent
shrubbery close at hand. Perhaps the memory of his own
sharp wound sprang into his mind. At all events, although
he knew that to utter the warning cry would debar himself
from the companionship of his kind, he unhesitatingly gave
that warning with no uncertain sound.</p>

<p>I laid down my rifle and pulled the raft in to the shore.
Michael was standing at the limit of his tether, gazing after
his retreating friends.</p>

<p>As the raft moved he sprang into the air, only to be jerked
back by the restraining cord. I untied the string from the
raft and drew the bird toward me. He submitted to my
caresses, but I guessed how earnestly he longed to soar away
after his kindred. He had saved some of them from death
or captivity; they were free to roam the clear air of heaven
while he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>I quickly untied the string from Michael's leg and gently
pushed the bird from me. Instantly he spread his wings and
sprang upward. With eager neck outstretched he swept
rapidly after the vanishing flock, uttering hearty "honks" of
jubilation.</p>

<p>I felt that he was worthy of liberty.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
